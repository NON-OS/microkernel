//! A Merkle commitment whose node hash is the Poseidon permutation rather than
//! BLAKE3. Its point is not speed but arithmetization: every node is a fixed
//! sequence of field operations, so a path check can be expressed as AIR
//! constraints and proven inside another STARK. That is the commitment a
//! recursive verifier needs, since a bitwise hash like BLAKE3 cannot be proven
//! cheaply. Digests are `RATE` field elements; leaves are already digests.
