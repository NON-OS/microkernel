## What Is This

NØNOS is an operating system built from scratch in Rust. The core idea is simple: a computing session should start clean and leave no trace when it ends.

No swap. No hibernation. No persistent OS state. When power goes away, the session is gone.

The kernel follows a capability-based security model. There's no root user, no global privilege escalation. Access to resources requires explicit capability grants, enforced by the kernel at every boundary.

Everything runs in isolated address spaces. Services communicate through IPC. The kernel mediates all cross-boundary operations.

This isn't a Linux derivative or a POSIX clone. It's a different model of computing where privacy and integrity are architectural properties, not features bolted on after the fact.

---

## Development Status

NØNOS is in active development, transitioning toward a microkernel architecture. The system boots, runs services, and handles real workloads, but correctness and isolation guarantees are still being validated.

Current focus: process isolation, IPC reliability, scheduler correctness.

Expect rapid iteration. This is a live build.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/kernel-architecture.png" alt="NØNOS Kernel Architecture" width="900">
</p>

The diagram above shows the five trust layers that form the foundation of NØNOS. Each layer is cryptographically bound to the one below it. The bootloader validates the kernel through Ed25519 signatures before execution. The kernel verifies every capsule and service before loading. At the top, applications run in sandboxed environments with only the capabilities they were explicitly granted. This chain of verification starts at the hardware root of trust and extends all the way up to userspace. Nothing executes without proof of integrity.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines of Code | 563,004 |
| Rust Files | 6,807 |
| Trust Layers | 5 |
| Disk Writes | 0 (RAM-only) |
| Version | v0.8.4 |

### Five Trust Layers

| Layer | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 01 | Applications | ZK proof attestation, sandboxed execution, capability-gated syscalls |
| 02 | System Services | Capability isolation, IPC channels, service registry |
| 03 | Kernel | BLAKE3 integrity-verified, memory-safe Rust, microkernel design |
| 04 | Bootloader | Ed25519 signed, Groth16 ZK proofs, measured boot chain |
| 05 | Hardware Root of Trust | TPM integration, secure boot, UEFI firmware verification |

### Microkernel Design

The kernel handles only the essentials:
- Memory management and address space isolation
- Process scheduling and context switching
- Inter-process communication
- Capability enforcement
- Hardware abstraction for interrupts and timers

Everything else runs in userspace as isolated services. The filesystem, network stack, device drivers, and crypto services all run as separate processes. They communicate through typed IPC channels, and every operation requires an explicit capability check.

### Zero-State Execution

The system runs entirely in RAM. There's no persistent state by default. Boot from a verified image, do your work, power off. Nothing remains.

For workflows that need persistence, explicit encrypted vaults can be mounted. But the default is ephemeral. When you shut down, RAM is wiped. There's no hibernation image, no swap partition, no recovery files. Your session existed only while the machine was running.

### Capability-Based Security

Every resource access requires a capability token. Capabilities are unforgeable references that grant specific permissions to specific resources.

A process can only access what it's been explicitly granted. No ambient authority, no privilege inheritance, no confused deputy attacks. If a process doesn't have a capability, it can't even attempt the operation.

### Cryptographic Boot Chain

The bootloader verifies the kernel with Ed25519 signatures and Groth16 zero-knowledge proofs. The kernel is bound to the specific machine at attestation time. Tampering is mathematically detectable. The ZK proof attests that the kernel matches the expected hash without revealing the hash itself, enabling remote attestation while preserving privacy.

## Memory Layout

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/memory-layout.png" alt="Memory Layout" width="900">
</p>

This diagram shows how virtual memory is organized in NØNOS. The address space is split between userspace in the lower half and kernel space in the upper half, separated by the canonical hole that x86-64 requires. Each process gets its own page tables and sees only its own memory. The kernel is mapped into the upper half of every address space, but user code can't access it due to page table protections. The diagram shows key regions like the user stack growing downward, the heap growing upward, and the kernel's direct physical memory mapping that allows efficient access to hardware.

### Virtual Address Space

The kernel uses a 64-bit split address space with the canonical hole in the middle. Four-level paging (PML4 → PDPT → PD → PT). Each process has its own PML4, switched on context change via CR3.

**Userspace (lower half):**

| Region | Start | End | Size | Purpose |
|--------|-------|-----|------|---------|
| Code | `0x0000_0000_0040_0000` | varies | varies | Process executable (USER_CODE_START) |
| Heap | `0x0000_0001_0000_0000` | grows up | dynamic | brk/mmap allocations (USER_HEAP_START) |
| Stack | `0x0000_7FFF_FFFF_0000` | grows down | 2 MB | User stack (USER_STACK_BASE, USER_STACK_SIZE) |

**Kernel (upper half):**

| Region | Start | Size | Purpose |
|--------|-------|------|---------|
| Higher Half | `0xFFFF_8000_0000_0000` | — | Kernel base mapping |
| Direct Map | `0xFFFF_FFFF_B000_0000` | 256 MB | Physical memory window |
| Kernel Heap | `0xFFFF_FF00_0000_0000` | 256 MB | linked-list allocator arena |
| vmalloc | `0xFFFF_FF10_0000_0000` | 512 MB | Non-contiguous kernel allocations |

### Page Sizes

- 4 KB standard pages for fine-grained allocation
- 2 MB large pages for kernel mappings to reduce TLB pressure
- 1 GB huge pages for direct physical map when hardware supports it

Guard pages sit between stack regions to catch overflows. NX bit enforced on all data pages.

### Physical Memory

Frame allocator using buddy system for O(log n) allocation. Memory zones partition physical RAM:

| Zone | Range | Usage |
|------|-------|-------|
| DMA | 0 - 16 MB | Legacy device buffers requiring low addresses |
| Normal | 16 MB - 4 GB | General purpose allocations |
| High | > 4 GB | Large allocations, requires 64-bit addressing |

### Segment Selectors

GDT layout matching x86-64 long mode requirements:

| Selector | Segment | DPL | Constant |
|----------|---------|-----|----------|
| `0x08` | Kernel Code (64-bit) | 0 | KERNEL_CS |
| `0x10` | Kernel Data | 0 | KERNEL_DS |
| `0x1B` | User Code (64-bit) | 3 | USER_CS |
| `0x23` | User Data | 3 | USER_DS |

User code runs at ring 3. Kernel at ring 0. Syscalls via `syscall` instruction.

---

## Process Model

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/process-model.png" alt="Process Model" width="900">
</p>

The process model diagram illustrates how NØNOS manages isolated execution contexts. Each process has its own address space backed by separate page tables. When the kernel switches between processes, it loads the new process's CR3 register, completely changing the visible memory. The diagram shows the lifecycle from fork through execution to exit, and how parent-child relationships are tracked. Every process also carries a capability table that defines exactly what resources it can access.

### Process Control Block

Each process tracks:
- PID and parent PID
- Address space (CR3 root pointer)
- Capability table with all granted permissions
- File descriptor table for open files and sockets
- Signal handlers and pending signals
- Scheduling priority class
- CPU affinity mask for SMP placement

### Address Space Isolation

Every process runs in its own address space. The kernel maintains separate page tables per process. Context switch loads a new CR3 and flushes TLB (with PCID optimization when available).

```
Process A          Process B          Kernel
+---------+        +---------+        +---------+
| CR3_A   |        | CR3_B   |        | Shared  |
+---------+        +---------+        +---------+
| User    |        | User    |        | Kernel  |
| pages   |        | pages   |        | pages   |
| (priv)  |        | (priv)  |        | (mapped)|
+---------+        +---------+        +---------+
```

No process can access another's memory without explicit shared mapping granted through capabilities.

### Stack Configuration

| Type | Size | Constant |
|------|------|----------|
| User Stack | 2 MB | USER_STACK_SIZE |
| Kernel Stack | 16 KB | KERNEL_STACK_SIZE |

User RFLAGS initialized to `0x202` (interrupts enabled, reserved bit set).

---

## Inter-Process Communication

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/ipc-capabilities.png" alt="IPC & Capabilities" width="900">
</p>

This diagram shows how processes communicate in NØNOS. All IPC goes through the kernel. When process A wants to send a message to process B, it makes a syscall with the message and a capability proving it has permission to use that channel. The kernel validates the capability, copies the message to an internal buffer, enqueues it for the target, and wakes the receiver if it was blocked waiting. The capability bits shown in the diagram define what operations each process can perform. Without the right bits set, the kernel rejects the operation.

### Channels

Kernel-mediated message passing. Processes create channels and send typed messages.

```rust
Channel {
    sender: ProcessId,
    receiver: ProcessId,
    capacity: usize,
    messages: RingBuffer<Message>,
}
```

Both blocking and non-blocking modes are supported. Every channel operation requires a valid capability.

### IPC Primitives

| Primitive | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| MessagePassing | Bidirectional typed message queues with structured payloads |
| SharedMemory | Explicit mappings with copy-on-write semantics |
| Pipe | Unidirectional byte streams for classic Unix-style IPC |
| Socket | Socket-like bidirectional channel for network-style communication |
| Signal | Async notification delivery for events and interrupts |

### Message Format

```rust
Message {
    type: MessageType,
    sender: ProcessId,
    payload: [u8; MAX_PAYLOAD],
    capabilities: [CapId; MAX_CAPS],
}
```

Messages can carry capability tokens, enabling delegation. A process can grant a subset of its permissions to another process by including capability IDs in the message payload.

### Message Flow

1. `syscall send(cap, msg)` - userspace initiates
2. Kernel validates capability ownership and permissions
3. Kernel copies message to internal buffer (no shared memory)
4. Kernel enqueues in target queue
5. Kernel wakes receiver if blocked on recv()
6. `recv()` returns in target process with message

---

## Scheduler

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/scheduler.png" alt="Scheduler" width="900">
</p>

The scheduler diagram shows how NØNOS manages CPU time across processes. Five priority classes from RealTime down to Idle determine who runs next. Each CPU maintains its own runqueue to minimize lock contention in SMP systems. The diagram shows the context switch sequence: timer interrupt fires, current state is saved, the scheduler picks the next task, the new state is loaded, and execution resumes. Work stealing balances load when one CPU goes idle while another is overloaded.

### Algorithm

Priority-based preemptive scheduling with round-robin within priority levels. O(1) task selection with work-stealing load balancing across CPUs.

### Priority Classes

| Class | Timeslice | Behavior |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| RealTime | preemptive | Always runs first, no time limit |
| High | 5ms | Short timeslice for responsive tasks |
| Normal | 10ms | Default for most processes |
| Low | 20ms | Background tasks |
| Idle | background | Only when nothing else to run |

### Constants (from source)

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| MAX_CPUS | 256 | Maximum supported CPU cores |
| DEFAULT_TIME_SLICE | 10ms | Default quantum for Normal priority |
| LOAD_BALANCE_INTERVAL_TICKS | 100 | Ticks between rebalance checks |
| MIGRATION_THRESHOLD | 2 | Queue imbalance before migration |
| MAX_QUEUE_IMBALANCE | 4 | Maximum allowed queue length difference |

### Runqueue

Per-CPU runqueues to minimize lock contention:

```rust
Runqueue {
    current: Option<TaskId>,
    queues: [Vec<TaskId>; NUM_PRIORITIES],
    idle_task: TaskId,
}
```

### Scheduling Policy

1. **Preemptive**: Higher priority always preempts lower immediately
2. **Round-Robin**: Same priority tasks rotate on timeslice expiry
3. **Priority Boost**: I/O-bound tasks get temporary boost after waking
4. **Affinity**: Prefer same CPU for cache locality

### Load Balancing

1. **Work Stealing**: Idle CPUs pull from busy queues
2. **Push Migration**: Overloaded CPUs push tasks out
3. **Balance Period**: Rebalance every 100 ticks
4. **NUMA Aware**: Prefer local memory node

### Context Switch Sequence

1. Timer IRQ fires on APIC timer
2. Save RIP, RSP, RFLAGS to kernel stack
3. Save general-purpose registers (RAX-R15)
4. Save FPU/SSE state (lazy save optimization)
5. Call `pick_next()` to select next task from runqueue
6. Load new CR3 (switches address space)
7. Load general-purpose registers from new task
8. Load FPU state if task used FPU
9. Execute `iretq` to return to new process

## System Calls

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/syscalls.png" alt="Syscall Interface" width="900">
</p>

The syscall diagram shows the interface between userspace and the kernel. Register conventions follow System V ABI: RAX holds the syscall number, RDI through R9 hold arguments. The execution path shows every step from the `syscall` instruction through capability validation, argument sanitization, dispatch, handling, and return via `sysret`. Every syscall checks capabilities before executing. The diagram also shows the custom NØNOS syscalls for ZK proofs, capability management, and IPC alongside standard POSIX-compatible syscalls.

### Interface

`syscall` instruction with System V ABI:

| Register | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| RAX | syscall number |
| RDI | argument 1 |
| RSI | argument 2 |
| RDX | argument 3 |
| R10 | argument 4 |
| R8 | argument 5 |
| R9 | argument 6 |
| RAX | return value |

### Syscall Execution Path

1. Userspace executes `syscall` instruction
2. CPU saves RIP/RSP, switches to ring 0
3. Kernel saves full register state to kernel stack
4. Kernel checks capability for the requested operation
5. Kernel validates and sanitizes all arguments
6. Kernel dispatches to appropriate handler
7. Handler executes operation
8. Kernel restores registers
9. `sysret` returns to userspace at ring 3

2. **Unforgeable**: Kernel-managed, cannot be guessed or fabricated
3. **Revocable**: Generation counter invalidates old capabilities
4. **Derivable**: Create restricted copies with subset permissions
5. **Auditable**: All capability operations logged

### Enforcement

Every resource access checks capability:

1. Process presents capability ID in syscall
2. Kernel validates ownership and generation
3. Kernel checks permission bits against requested operation
4. Access granted or denied with appropriate error

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Rust Toolchain:**

```bash
# Install rustup if not present
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install the pinned nightly toolchain
rustup install nightly-2026-01-16
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-uefi --toolchain nightly-2026-01-16
rustup component add rust-src clippy rustfmt --toolchain nightly-2026-01-16
```

**QEMU:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install qemu

# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install qemu-system-x86

# Fedora
dnf install qemu-system-x86
```

**Optional - VirtualBox:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install --cask virtualbox

# Or download from virtualbox.org
```

**Optional - ISO Creation:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install xorriso gptfdisk mtools

# Ubuntu/Debian
apt install xorriso gdisk mtools
```

### Build and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NON-OS/nonos-kernel.git
cd nonos-kernel
make run
```

That's it. The build handles toolchain setup, key generation, ZK ceremony, and boots into QEMU.

---

## Building

### Full Build Pipeline

```bash
make all
```

This runs the complete pipeline:

1. **Toolchain verification** - Installs nightly-2026-01-16 if missing
2. **Signing key generation** - Creates Ed25519 key pair (if missing)
3. **ZK trusted setup** - Generates Groth16 proving/verifying keys (if missing)
4. **Bootloader compilation** - Builds UEFI bootloader for x86_64-unknown-uefi
5. **Kernel compilation** - Builds kernel for x86_64-nonos custom target
6. **Ed25519 signing** - Signs kernel binary
7. **ZK proof generation** - Generates Groth16 attestation proof
8. **EFI System Partition** - Creates bootable ESP directory

**Build Output:**

```

### Individual Build Targets

```bash
# Build components separately
make bootloader      # Build UEFI bootloader only
make kernel          # Build kernel only
make sign-kernel     # Sign kernel with Ed25519
make embed-zk-proof  # Generate ZK attestation proof
make esp             # Create EFI System Partition

# Cryptographic keys
make ensure-signing-key  # Generate signing key if missing
make ensure-zk-keys      # Generate ZK keys if missing
make generate-zk-keys    # Force regenerate ZK keys
make zk-tools            # Build ZK attestation tools
```

### Code Quality

```bash
make fmt      # Format code with rustfmt
make check    # Run clippy lints
make test     # Run test suite
```

### Minimal Build

For embedded or minimal deployments:

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features "kernel,standalone"
```

This produces a ~200KB kernel with only the essentials.

Set via UEFI Shell:

```
Shell> set NONOS_SECURITY_LEVEL standard
```

### Kernel Features

Enable/disable features in Cargo.toml or via cargo flags:

```bash
# Minimal kernel
cargo build --no-default-features --features "kernel,standalone"

# With specific drivers
cargo build --features "drivers-nvme,drivers-e1000,net-tcp"

# Full production build (default)
cargo build
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**"rustup not found"**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

**"OVMF not found"**

```bash
# macOS
brew install qemu  # Includes OVMF

# Or download manually to firmware/OVMF.fd
```

**"xorriso not found" (for ISO creation)**

```bash
# macOS
brew install xorriso

# Linux
apt install xorriso
```

**"sgdisk/mtools not found" (for USB image)**

```bash
# macOS
brew install gptfdisk mtools

# Linux
apt install gdisk mtools
```

### Runtime Issues

**Kernel panics immediately**

- Check QEMU has UEFI firmware (OVMF)
- Ensure you're using the correct architecture (x86_64)
- Try `make debug` and connect with GDB

**No network connectivity**

- Check VirtIO drivers are enabled
- Try e1000 driver: `cargo build --features drivers-e1000`
- Check port forwarding in QEMU

**Black screen after boot**

- Try `make run-serial` for serial output
- Check framebuffer driver is enabled
- Verify OVMF_VARS.fd exists

## From the Team

The last weeks have been intense. Not the visible kind, but the kind where you realize the system works... just not how it should. That's when the microkernel transition started.

We moved from a tightly coupled kernel toward strict isolation. Services are real processes now, in their own address spaces, talking through IPC, with access enforced explicitly.

Sounds clean on paper. In practice it meant removing every shortcut the system relied on.

Today most things work as intended. Service spawn, address spaces, scheduling, IPC. Other parts need correction. At this level, things don't "kind of work". Either context switching is correct or it isn't. Either isolation holds or it doesn't.

This phase is about proving correctness. Not adding features.

v0.8.4 drops this week. Everything comes together into a usable system. Not just architecturally correct, but something you can run day to day.
