//! Hosting code the kernel does not trust and does not understand.
//!
//! A foreign process holds no capabilities, so every NONOS syscall it makes
//! is refused at the contract gate. What it can do is issue a syscall
//! number this kernel has never heard of, which is exactly what a binary
//! built for another system does. Rather than answering `ENOSYS`, the
//! kernel hands that register frame to the userspace supervisor that
//! created the process and parks the caller until an answer comes back.
//!
//! The kernel copies six registers out and one value in. It does not read
//! them, does not know what they mean, and holds no table that could tell
//! it. Every syscall number, struct, path and errno belongs to the
//! supervisor, an ordinary attested capsule that can be replaced or
//! revoked without touching ring 0.
