//! Capability inheritance policy for new PCBs.
//!
//! Syscall authority is now decided through `pcb.capability_token`;
//! `pcb.caps_bits` is the derived bitmap cache. This module produces
//! the inherited bitmap that seeds both — the cache directly, and
//! the initial token via `process::caps::new_token`. The bits stay
//! in the `crate::capabilities::Capability` namespace.
//!
//! Two policy knobs live here:
//!   - `AMBIENT_CAPS`: init's production-ambient set, also the
//!     upper bound on inheritance. Hardware authority (Driver,
//!     DeviceEnum, Mmio, Irq, Dma, Pio), Admin, Debug, and the
//!     graphics caps are never ambient. They must be granted by
//!     each capsule's spawn spec.
//!   - `debug_grant()`: a smoketest-only OR over the ambient set
//!     so `MkDebug` is reachable from init under the proof feature.
//!
//! A compile-time assertion below proves `AMBIENT_CAPS` carries
//! none of the forbidden bits.
