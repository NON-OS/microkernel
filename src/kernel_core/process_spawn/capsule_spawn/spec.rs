/*
 * Borrowed for the length of the spawn call, not for the life of the machine.
 *
 * A baked capsule's artifacts come from `include_bytes!` and are 'static, and
 * they coerce into this without anyone noticing. A capsule loaded at runtime
 * owns its four blobs in a Vec that the caller drops when the call returns.
 *
 * The lifetime used to be 'static for both, which meant the runtime path had
 * to leak: `Box::leak` on every artifact, on the success path and on the
 * failure path alike. Nothing needs them to live that long. The endpoint
 * registry copies the name into a String, the process control block copies it
 * again, and the ELF is mapped into the process address space before the call
 * returns. After that the bytes have no reader.
