//! Deferred per-process kernel stack release. Teardown runs on the
//! dying capsule's own kernel stack, so the actual `deallocate_page`
//! has to wait until the CPU has context-switched off it. The list
//! is per-CPU; only the originating core drains its own deferred
//! stacks, which keeps the API correct once SMP goes live.
