// Microkernel hardware bring-up surface. The boot path needs PCI
// enumeration (from `init_core_systems`), the virtio-rng entropy probe
// (from `init_entropy`), and the security helpers used by the trusted
// memory/IPC paths.
//
// `device_info` enumerates devices through the legacy `critical`
// taxonomy and only ships diagnostics for the gated audio/gpu/xhci/ahci
// stack; no microkernel caller reads it.
