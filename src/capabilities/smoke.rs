//! Single source for the smoketest-only `Capability::Debug` grant.
//!
//! `MkDebug` is gated by `Capability::Debug`. Production builds do
//! not grant that bit to any process; only the boot smoketests need
//! capsule-emitted serial markers, and only those builds OR this
//! function's result into a process's `caps_bits` at mint time.
//!
//! Two consumers exist:
//!   - `process::core::table::inherit::init_caps_bits` (init's
//!     ambient set; proof_io reaches MkDebug through that).
//!   - `kernel_core::process_spawn::capsule_spawn::runner::install_caps`
//!     (every spawned capsule).
//!
//! Both call sites use this helper so the cfg list lives in one
//! place and a new smoketest profile only has to touch this file.
