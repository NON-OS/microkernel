// Capsule lifecycle primitives.
//
// Every userland-capsule kernel-side module (entropy, crypto, vfs,
// keyring, ramfs, ...) tracks the capsule's pid + an epoch-style
// generation that bumps on every spawn. Before this module each
// capsule duplicated the same atomics + same liveness check + same
// `mark_dead` logic. They now share `CapsuleState`.
//
// Generation tagging exists so a client request that races a respawn
// returns deterministic ESTALE: the transport captures the generation
// at send time and rejects any reply observed under a different
// generation, even if the request_id happens to match.
