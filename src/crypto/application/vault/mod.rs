// Older application-side vault. The real vault now lives at `src/vault` —
// secret custody, sealing, key lifecycle, and trust policy belong there.
// This tree only stays around because the crypto syscall in
// `src/crypto/core/syscall.rs` and the shell vault commands under
// `src/shell/commands/vault/*` still reach in for `init_vault`,
// `store_key`, `retrieve_key`, `get_signing_key`, `get_public_key`, and
// the rest. Wave 6 is where those callers get moved to
// `crate::vault::nonos_vault::*`; once that lands, this whole directory
// should be deleted.
//
// A few internals here shouldn't survive the migration. A vault has no
// business owning its own RNG (`random::generate_random_bytes` duplicates
// `crate::crypto::util::rng`) or its own secure-memory allocator
// (`crate::memory::secure_memory` is the real one). Zeroization should
// route through canonical primitives. The `MemoryType` and key-type names
// here also clash with definitions elsewhere and need to collapse.
//
// Don't extend the public API here, don't add new key-handling logic.
// Edits should only land as part of moving callers off this tree.
