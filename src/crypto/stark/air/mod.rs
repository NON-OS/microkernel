//! An end-to-end STARK over an algebraic intermediate representation. A trace is
//! interpolated and extended onto an evaluation coset, its constraints become a
//! composition polynomial, FRI proves that composition is low degree, and query
//! openings bind it to the committed trace. The AIR is a trait, so one engine
//! proves any computation expressed as a trace with transition and boundary
//! constraints. This closes the transparent, post-quantum proof system: the
//! verifier is proven against forgeries, not assumed sound.
