//! NONOS wallpaper capsule wiring. One-shot graphics proof. Embeds
//! the userland binary at build time, seeds it into the ramfs at
//! boot, and runs it once via `exec_process` to drive the
//! display_dimensions / surface_create / surface_map /
//! surface_present_full / surface_destroy round trip from CPL=3.
//!
//! Feature-gated by `nonos-capsule-wallpaper`. With the feature
//! off, `seed` and `launch` are no-ops; the kernel build does not
//! reference any userland artifact.
