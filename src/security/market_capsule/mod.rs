//! Kernel-side glue for the userland marketplace capsule. The
//! kernel embeds the binary, spawns it, registers the
//! `market.index` service inbox, and exposes a thin IPC client.
//! It does not parse marketplace JSON, it does not know NOX or
//! pricing policy — those live in the userland capsule and the
//! `marketplace_abi` wire-form crate.
