// `MkIrq*` handlers. Cap-gated by `Capability::Irq` at the contract
// layer. Backend lives in `hardware::broker::irq`, selected per arch:
// x86_64 = IO-APIC + MSI-X, aarch64 = GICv3 SPI, riscv64 = PLIC.
// Modes the active arch's broker rejects (e.g. MSI-X on aarch64) come
// back as `UnsupportedFlags` and are mapped to ENOTSUP.
