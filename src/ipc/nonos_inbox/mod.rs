//! Per-process IPC inboxes.
//!
//! Every inbox is registered with an explicit owner pid. Sends use
//! `try_enqueue_strict`, which fails closed when the inbox is
//! missing, when its owner pid has exited, or when the bounded queue
//! is full. There is no auto-registration on the IPC paths; the only
//! way to materialise an inbox is `register_inbox(name, owner_pid)`
//! (capsule-owned) or `register_or_get_bootstrap_inbox(name)`
//! (kernel-owned reply inbox, set up at spawn time).
//!
//! Capsule lifecycle integrates through `unregister_for_pid(pid)`,
//! called from `process::exit::teardown` to drop a dying capsule's
//! `proc.{pid}` inbox along with everything still queued in it.
