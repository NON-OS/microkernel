//! IPC Channel and Message Bus
//!
//! Provides the core IPC message passing infrastructure:
//! - `IpcMessage` - Message with integrity checksum
//! - `IpcChannel` - Handle to a registered route
//! - `IpcBus` - Global message bus with channel registry
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The IPC bus maintains a registry of channels (routes between modules).
//! Messages are enqueued on the bus and later dequeued for delivery.
//! Each channel is identified by a BLAKE3-derived key for fast lookup.
//!
//! # RAM-Only Design
//!
//! All channel state is held in memory. No persistence layer exists.
//! On system reset, all channels and queued messages are lost.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use nonos_kernel::ipc::nonos_channel::{IPC_BUS, IpcMessage};
//!
//! // Open a channel
//! IPC_BUS.open_channel("sender", "receiver", &token)?;
//!
//! // Find and send on channel
//! if let Some(channel) = IPC_BUS.find_channel("sender", "receiver") {
//!     let msg = IpcMessage::new("sender", "receiver", &data)?;
//!     channel.send(msg)?;
//! }
//! ```
