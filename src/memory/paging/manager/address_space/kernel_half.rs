//! Pre-seed every kernel-half PML4 entry with a backing PDPT.
//!
//! Walked once at boot from `create_kernel_address_space`, before
//! any user CR3 is cloned. Any PML4[256..511] entry that is not
//! already present gets a fresh, zeroed PDPT frame allocated and
//! installed with `present | writable`. The PDPTs are global state
//! shared by every address space cloned afterwards; sub-table
//! allocations (PD, PT, leaf) flow into them and propagate to all
//! address spaces without further bookkeeping.
