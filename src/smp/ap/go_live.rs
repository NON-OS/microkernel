     * idle AP, and the symptom arrives stages later as a TLB shootdown timeout
     * with nothing pointing back here.
     *
     * After `sti`, and that is not a detail. Printing takes the serial lock,
     * which is a plain spin mutex the boot CPU holds and releases hundreds of
     * times while it brings the system up. An AP contending for it before
     * interrupts are enabled spins with them masked: it answers no timer tick
     * and no shootdown for as long as the boot CPU keeps printing, which is
     * long enough to lose a shootdown round. Reporting here costs the same
     * information and none of that.
