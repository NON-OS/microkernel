8250/16550 UART driver for COM1 debug output.

Standard PC serial port at 0x3F8, configured for 115200 baud 8N1.
Used for kernel debug logging during boot and runtime.

Many modern machines (HP Elitedesk, some Dell Optiplex, etc) ship
without a physical serial port. The line status register reads 0xFF
on these systems, so we timeout the transmit wait to avoid hanging
the boot process. Output is simply dropped if no UART is present.

/*
Run one logical output unit holding the COM1 lock with interrupts
disabled, so concurrent CPUs and same-core ISRs cannot interleave
bytes mid-line. The closure must emit only through `write_byte`;
nesting another locked print inside would self-deadlock the
non-reentrant spinlock, so callers keep the byte loop inline.

The fatal path's writer, aarch64 only. A CPU that traps while it holds
SERIAL_LOCK, or while another CPU that will never run again holds it,
would spin in with_serial_lock forever and the trap would never be
named. So the lock is taken if it frees within a bounded number of
tries, and the line is written either way: a line interleaved with
another CPU's output can still be read, a line never written cannot.
With the MMU off the lock is not touched at all. Its word is Device
memory then, and exclusive access to Device memory is not guaranteed
to work.
