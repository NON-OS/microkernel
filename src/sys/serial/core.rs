/*
8250/16550 UART driver for COM1 debug output.

Standard PC serial port at 0x3F8, configured for 115200 baud 8N1.
Used for kernel debug logging during boot and runtime.

Many modern machines (HP Elitedesk, some Dell Optiplex, etc) ship
without a physical serial port. The line status register reads 0xFF
on these systems, so we timeout the transmit wait to avoid hanging
the boot process. Output is simply dropped if no UART is present.
