//! Kernel-side glue for the virtio-net userland driver capsule.
//! Embed, spawn, and a thin IPC client that mirrors the userland
//! endpoint surface (healthcheck, link_status, mac_address,
//! tx_packet, rx_packet). The kernel does not touch the device
//! and does not implement network policy — frames go through a
//! verbatim transport, period.
