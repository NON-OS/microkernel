//! Kernel-side glue for the virtio-blk userland driver capsule.
//! Embed, spawn, and a thin IPC client that mirrors the userland
//! endpoint surface (healthcheck, capacity, read_blocks,
//! write_blocks, flush). The kernel does not touch the device —
//! the capsule speaks broker syscalls and owns the queue.
