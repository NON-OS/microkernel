//! DMA grant revocation. Three triggers:
//!
//!   * `MkDmaUnmap` — explicit holder request
//!   * `MkDeviceRelease` — drains every grant tied to the device
//!   * process exit — drains every grant the dying pid owns
//!
//! Revocation order: scrub the buffer, unmap user pages (when the
//! holder's CR3 is active so the unmap is in-context), free the
//! physical frame back to the allocator. The cross-pid teardown
//! path skips the unmap because dereferencing a foreign address
//! space would walk the wrong page tables; the AS reaper drops
//! those PTEs wholesale.
