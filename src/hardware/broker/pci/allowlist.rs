//! Pure validator for `MkPciConfigWrite`. The whole authority lives
//! in this function: only PCI Command bit 2 (Bus Master Enable) and
//! the MSI-X Message Control register's Function Mask + Enable bits
//! may flip. Every other config-space write — BAR programming,
//! interrupt line, IDs, status, expansion ROM, capability pointer
//! mutation, PCIe / AER — is rejected before it reaches the bus.
