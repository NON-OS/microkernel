//! Kernel-private side table mapping a broker `device_id` back to
//! the PCI bits the kernel needs in order to program MSI/MSI-X on
//! behalf of a capsule. The wire-form `DeviceRecord` deliberately
//! does not carry MSI capability descriptors or the BDF — those
//! are kernel-only and must never reach a capsule. This table is
//! how the broker bridges between the opaque id the capsule sees
//! and the structures the PCI layer requires.
