// at low phys), the handoff struct, the boot stack, the memory
// map area, and the framebuffer (if low-mapped) all live here on
// every UEFI platform we ship. Identity-mapping [0,
// IDENTITY_LOW_BYTES) keeps every `mov rax, [imm]` and every
// `jmp rip+offset` valid across the CR3 swap, which is the only
// way the bootloader can switch CR3 and immediately call
// `jump_to_kernel` without a fault. The window must reach the
// firmware's image load phys (OVMF/QEMU 10.2.0 places it > 4 GiB).
//
// 1 GiB hugepages: IDENTITY_LOW_BYTES / 1 GiB entries in PML4[0]'s
// single PDPT (cap 512 GiB) cover the whole region.
