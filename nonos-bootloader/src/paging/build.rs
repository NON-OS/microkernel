// stack, mmap area, and framebuffer stay reachable across the CR3
// swap even when firmware loads the image > 4 GiB), a 256 GiB
// linear directmap
// rooted at PML4[256] (the kernel's `phys_to_virt` window), and
// per-PT_LOAD phys -> virt mappings rooted at PML4[511] for the
// upper-half kernel image.
//
// Returns the new PML4's physical address. Caller switches CR3 to
// this value via `switch_to_kernel_pml4` after ExitBootServices has
// been called and the memory map is finalized.
