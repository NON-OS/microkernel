// Copy `len` payload bytes from `payload[src_off..src_off+len]` to
// the bootloader-allocated phys frame at `dst_phys`. The phys frame
// is identity-mapped while UEFI Boot Services are still active, so
// the raw cast is sound.
//
// SAFETY:
//   - `dst_phys` must be a 4 KiB-aligned phys page allocated by the
//     loader and not freed.
//   - `[dst_phys, dst_phys + len)` must lie within that allocation.
//   - `src_off + len <= payload.len()`.
