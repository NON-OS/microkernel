//! Bringing up a program and, when it asks for one, its interpreter.
//!
//! A dynamically linked executable does not start at its own entry: the
//! kernel of a real Linux system loads the interpreter named in
//! `PT_INTERP` beside it and starts there instead, and the interpreter
//! then maps the libraries and jumps to the program. This does the same,
//! with the store standing in for the filesystem.
