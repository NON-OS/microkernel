// image: a trailer compiled into this binary changes the binary, which changes
// the root that produced the trailer, so an embedded copy can never converge.

// payload at the absolute path its own descriptor carries. A device that is
// missing, wedged, or carrying a foreign container leaves /capsules empty
// instead of failing the capsule, since the rest of the filesystem still works.
