# capsule_terminal

## Role

`capsule_terminal` is a real production application capsule built on
`nonos_app_skeleton`. It owns a line buffer fronted by a fixed-size scrollback
ring. The capsule keeps its own state, has no globals, and reads keyboard
input through the toolkit. The capsule routes UI rendering through the toolkit
IPC path rather than through any kernel UI code.

```text
terminal app
    |
    | UI frame request
    v
toolkit endpoint
    |
    `-- app event loop on app endpoint
```

## Microkernel contract

The capsule uses the basic Mk surface that every app skeleton uses:

- `MkIpcCall` sends a UI frame request to the toolkit endpoint.
- `MkIpcRecv` receives application messages on the app endpoint.
- `MkYield` backs off when no message is available.
- `MkDebug` emits ownership and proof markers.
- `MkExit` exits when the IPC surface is parked.

The active spawn path is the standard `nonos_app_skeleton::run` entry point.

## Interface contract

| Call | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MkIpcCall` to toolkit | request a UI frame through userland toolkit policy |
| `MkIpcRecv` on app endpoint | receive app input messages |
| `MkYield`, `MkDebug`, `MkExit` | cooperative loop and proof markers |

The keyboard surface accepts printable characters, Backspace, Enter to commit
a line, and Esc to clear the input.

## Authority

The capsule keeps the narrow capability set defined by the app skeleton. It
does not request shell execution, kernel debug surfaces, network, filesystem,
device drivers, or direct framebuffer authority. The terminal does not
actually run commands today; lines are echoed into the scrollback ring.

## Privacy and persistence

The capsule keeps no profile, no telemetry, and no persistent state. The
input line and the scrollback ring disappear with the process. Persistence is
explicitly out of scope until a storage contract exists.

## Runtime lifecycle

The capsule emits ownership markers, enters the app skeleton run loop, and
processes input events through `MkIpcRecv` until the IPC surface is parked. On
clean shutdown the runtime state is gone with the process.

## Failure model

Toolkit failure is observable through proof markers and never grants the
capsule a fallback framebuffer path. Invalid input is dropped by the terminal
state machine and never escalates to a kernel call.

## Current implemented surface

- Source for the input line, the scrollback ring, theme, painter, and event
  loop.
- Keyboard surface for printable characters, Backspace, Enter, and Esc.
- Fixed capacity scrollback ring with deterministic eviction.
- Runs above `nonos_app_skeleton` with toolkit-only UI.

## Wire format

Input messages arrive on the app endpoint as toolkit input events. UI requests
go out on the toolkit endpoint.

## State ownership

The capsule owns the input line and the scrollback ring. The toolkit owns
rendering. The compositor owns scene and focus. The kernel owns no terminal
state.

## Operating rules

- Route UI through toolkit IPC only.
- Do not request direct framebuffer authority.
- Keep all app state volatile until a storage contract exists.
- Do not introduce kernel UI exports for this app.

## Release target

The release version is a signed application capsule with `Capsule.mk`, signed
manifest, feature gated spawn, toolkit only UI rendering, an explicit
capability for any shell execution surface, and smoke proof that terminal
policy stays out of the kernel.

## Release checklist

- `Capsule.mk` and signed manifest exist.
- Toolkit IPC smoke passes.
- Feature gated spawn is present.
- Static gate confirms no kernel app UI exports.

## Explicit non-goals today

No production manifest, signed spawn path, real command execution, network
access, filesystem access, graphics driver access, or direct framebuffer
authority belongs in this directory.

## Verification

- Build: `cargo build --manifest-path userland/capsule_terminal/Cargo.toml`
- Static gate: `bash nonos-ci/run-static-checks.sh`
- Promotion check: add `Capsule.mk`, manifest signing, feature gated spawn,
  and smoke proof before claiming production app status.
