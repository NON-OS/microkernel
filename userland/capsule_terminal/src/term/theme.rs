//! The terminal palette.
//!
//! Near black rather than pure black, because the chrome is drawn by lifting
//! the background a few steps and there is nowhere to lift from at zero. The
//! accent is one colour used consistently for what the system says about
//! itself, and it is kept apart from the colours that carry meaning: a reader
//! who has learned that green passed and red failed should not have to
//! relearn it because those are also the brand.
//!
//! The choices are System, which follows the OS theme set in Settings and is
//! the default, then the named profiles with their own fixed colours.
//!
//! Chrome in the window body (header, footer, input bar, command blocks) is not
//! stored but derived from the active background via paint::shade::elevate,
//! so every profile including the translucent ones stays complete. The tab
//! strip sits in the titlebar and takes the OS theme's roles.
