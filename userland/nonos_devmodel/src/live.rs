//! A device that answers back.
//!
//! [`FakeBar`](super::FakeBar) alone is memory, and memory reads back whatever
//! was written to it. That is enough to check what a driver leaves behind and
//! not enough for a handshake: a reset that writes a bit and waits for the
//! device to drop it spins forever against a passive window, so the refusal
//! paths, the ones worth proving, are unreachable.
//!
//! The way out is not to intercept the driver's reads. It is to put a second
//! agent on the register file, which is what a device is: the driver polls
//! memory while the device concurrently changes it. [`run`] starts a closure
//! on its own thread and lets it do exactly that, written from the
//! specification. It proves the driver against a device that behaves as the
//! specification describes; it does not model timing or silicon errata.
//!
//! The README says what a concurrent model can and cannot reach, and why a
//! property it cannot reach stays documented rather than asserted.
