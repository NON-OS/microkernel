# NONOS Userland

This tree holds every NONOS process that runs at CPL=3. The kernel runs at CPL=0; everything in `userland/` ships as ring-3 ELF binaries that the kernel loads, isolates, and talks to either through return values from a syscall or, for server capsules, through a wire protocol on top of MkIpc.

Three things cross the line and nothing else: the `SYSCALL` instruction (one site, `libc/src/syscall/raw.rs`), the ELF embedded via `include_bytes!` and loaded by the kernel-side spawn, and IPC envelopes through `MkIpcSend`/`Recv`/`Call`.

## Capsule status

| Capsule | Class | Build | Kernel mirror | Spawn site wired | Live consumers | Boot-test proven |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| capsule_proof_io | one-shot | yes | `crate::userspace::capsule_proof_io` | yes (`init::run_init`) | n/a (one-shot) | yes (boot run prints marker) |
| capsule_ramfs | server | yes | `src/fs/ramfs_capsule/` | yes (`init::run_init`) | yes (capsule fd path) | yes (`tests/boot/ramfs_round_trip.sh`) |
| capsule_keyring | server | yes | `src/security/keyring_capsule/` | yes (`init::run_init`) | none yet | not yet (smoketest + harness pending) |
| capsule_entropy | server | yes | `src/security/entropy_capsule/` | yes (`init::run_init`) | none yet | not yet |
| capsule_crypto | server | yes | `src/security/crypto_capsule/` | yes (`init::run_init`) | none yet | not yet |
| capsule_vfs | server | yes | `src/fs/vfs_capsule/` | yes (`init::run_init`) | none yet | not yet |
| capsule_wallpaper | one-shot | yes | not yet | not yet | n/a (one-shot) | not yet |

"Live consumers" means a kernel-side caller that already routes through the capsule client. Entropy, crypto, and VFS are built and spawn from `run_init`, but their kernel-side call sites are not yet re-pointed off the legacy `*_engine` wrappers. Until that lands and a boot-test confirms the round trip, those capsules are not runtime-proven.

```

There are exactly two crate kinds. `libc` is a static library (`staticlib + rlib`). The seven `capsule_*` directories are `bin` crates. Nothing else lives here.

## Toolchain

| Pin | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| `nightly-2026-01-16` | `Makefile` `TOOLCHAIN :=` |
| `x86_64-nonos-user` target | `userland/x86_64-nonos-user.json` |
| `-Zbuild-std=core,alloc` | every Makefile capsule rule |

Every capsule and the libc are built with this exact toolchain. Mixing toolchains within `userland/` is a bug; build artifacts will pick up incompatible `compiler_builtins` revisions.

## Target spec

`userland/x86_64-nonos-user.json` is the userland target. It pins:

- `target-pointer-width: 64`, `arch: x86_64`, `vendor: unknown`, `os: nonos`
- `panic-strategy: abort`
- no red zone (kernel manages signal stacks, no leaf-function stack reuse)
- statically linked, no dynamic linker
- single `_start` entry, no `_main`/CRT shim

The kernel's own target is `x86_64-nonos.json`. The userland target is distinct so that no userland binary ever sees a kernel-only relocation type or feature.

## The libc

`userland/libc/` is the single runtime that every capsule links against. It is `no_std`, exposes a `_start`/`_exit` ABI, owns the panic handler, owns the heap allocator, and owns every syscall wrapper. Capsule code does not call `syscall` instructions directly; it calls a libc wrapper.

### Surface

| Family | Module | Symbols |
|---|---|---|
| Process control | `unistd` | `_exit`, `read`, `write` |
| Memory | `mem` | `mmap` |
| Heap | `heap` | `init` (alias `heap_init`), `HeapError` |
| IPC | `ipc` | `mk_ipc_send`, `mk_ipc_recv`, `mk_ipc_call` |
| Crypto | `crypto` | `crypto_random`, `crypto_encrypt`, `crypto_decrypt` |
| Graphics | `graphics` | `nonos_display_dimensions`, `nonos_surface_create/destroy/map/present_full`, `NONOS_PIXEL_FMT_ARGB8888` |
| Signal trampoline | `signal` | `__nonos_rt_sigreturn` |
| Panic | `panic` | `_exit(134)` (private) |

### Allocator

`heap::init()` binds 4 MiB of anonymous private mmap as the allocator backing, then hands ownership to a `linked_list_allocator`. Allocations beyond 4 MiB are not currently grown; OOM goes through `alloc_error_handler`, which calls the panic handler, which calls `_exit(134)`. A capsule that cannot allocate cannot serve, so abort is the correct response.

`heap_init()` is one-shot. The first successful call locks initialisation; later calls return `HeapError::AlreadyInitialized`. Server capsules must call it before their `run()` loop. One-shot capsules that never allocate do not need to call it.

### Panic

`#[panic_handler]` calls `_exit(134)`. 134 is `128 + 6`, the conventional SIGABRT exit code. The kernel observes it through normal process exit accounting. There is no userland panic message printed, and no double-fault path; the panic handler returns `!`.

### Syscall trampoline

```
rax = number
rdi = a1, rsi = a2, rdx = a3
r10 = a4 (rcx is clobbered by SYSCALL itself)
r8  = a5
r9  = a6
return in rax
clobbers: rcx (return RIP), r11 (return RFLAGS)
```

`raw()` in `libc/src/syscall/raw.rs` is the only place this assembly lives. Every wrapper goes through `call_raw(N_*, [u64; 6])`. There is no second syscall path.

### Syscall numbering blocks

Kernel side is the source of truth (`crate::syscall::numbers::SyscallNumber`). The libc mirrors numbers in `userland/libc/src/syscall/numbers.rs`.

| Range | Family |
|---|---|
| 0..99 | POSIX-shape (read=0, write=1, mmap=9, rt_sigreturn=15, exit=60) |
| 900..999 | crypto (random=900, encrypt=904, decrypt=905) |
| 1300..1399 | graphics (display dims=1300, surface create=1301, destroy=1302, map=1303, present_full=1304) |
| 0x1000..0x1FFF | microkernel IPC (send=0x1000, recv=0x1001, call=0x1002) |

When adding a new family, claim a block. Do not interleave new numbers into an existing block.

## Capsule classes

Two patterns coexist. Each has a different kernel-side lifecycle contract.

### Server capsule

`heap_init` first, then an infinite `run()` that drives `mk_ipc_recv` and writes back via `mk_ipc_send`. The kernel side allocates a SERVICE_PORT and a REPLY_PORT, registers the capsule in the service registry, tracks liveness against the process table, and bumps a generation counter on respawn so stale handles fail deterministically.

Examples: `capsule_ramfs`, `capsule_keyring`, `capsule_entropy`, `capsule_crypto`, `capsule_vfs`.

### One-shot capsule

Do work, then `_exit(N)`. No IPC server, no liveness tracking, no generation counter, no restart expectation. The kernel spawns it, waits for the exit code (or just observes it left), and moves on.

Examples: `capsule_proof_io`, `capsule_wallpaper`.

A capsule must be one or the other. Do not write a half-server, half-one-shot. If you need a one-shot that occasionally accepts an IPC, it is a server with a short timeout.

## Process lifecycle

Every spawn function in `src/{security,fs}/<name>_capsule/spawn.rs` runs the same pipeline. Every step is observable in source under the named module path; there is no implicit step.

```
   spawn_<name>_capsule()
            │
            ▼
   nonos_inbox::register_inbox(REPLY_INBOX)     server only

            ▼

            │
            ▼
   load_elf_executable(BIN)                     PT_LOAD segments map into the capsule AS
            │
            ▼
   switch_address_space(KERNEL_ASID)            CR3 := kernel
            │                                   ├─ Ok    →  continue
            │                                   └─ Err   →  serial println [FATAL] + halt_loop
            ▼
   install_caps(pid, IPC | Memory | Crypto)     explicit; no implicit cap escalation
            │
            ▼
   allocate_service_stack(pid)
   setup_initial_context(pid, entry, stack_top)
            │
            ▼
   register_endpoint(SERVICE_NAME, port, pid, caps)   server only
            │
            ▼
   add_to_run_queue(pid)
   state.set_alive(pid)                         bumps generation; the new epoch is live

   ── from here the scheduler dispatches _start ──

       server capsule:               one-shot capsule:
       heap_init()                   linear work via syscalls
       loop {                         _exit(N)
         mk_ipc_recv → dispatch
         mk_ipc_send to REPLY
       }
```

`switch_address_space(KERNEL_ASID)` failure is fail-hard. Continuing in an unknown CR3 would corrupt every later capsule operation, so the kernel halts instead of returning.

### What the kernel installs at spawn

| Resource | Source |
|---|---|
| Address space | `crate::process::address_space::lifecycle::allocate` (called by `create_process`) |
| CR3 switch for ELF load | `crate::memory::paging::manager::switch_to_process_address_space(pid)` |
| ELF image | `crate::elf::loader::load_elf_executable(BIN)` |
| CR3 rollback | `crate::memory::paging::manager::switch_address_space(KERNEL_ASID)` (fail-hard on error) |
| Capability mask | `Capability::IPC.bit() \| Capability::Memory.bit() \| Capability::Crypto.bit()` (default) |
| Stack | `crate::kernel_core::process_spawn::allocate_service_stack(pid)` |
| Initial context | `crate::kernel_core::process_spawn::setup_initial_context(pid, entry, stack_top)` |
| Service endpoint | `crate::services::registry::register_endpoint(SERVICE_NAME, SERVICE_PORT, pid, caps)` (server only) |
| Reply inbox | `crate::ipc::nonos_inbox::register_inbox(REPLY_INBOX)` (server only) |
| Lifecycle state | `crate::services::lifecycle::CapsuleState` (shared primitive: pid, generation, is_alive) |

A capsule may need additional caps; if it does, the spawn function for that capsule grants them explicitly. There is no implicit cap escalation; any cap the capsule does not get at spawn it can never get.

## IPC contract for server capsules

Two wire-header shapes coexist during the migration. New capsules use the v1 header; ramfs and keyring still use the seq-only header until they are rewritten on top of v1.

### v1 header (20 bytes)

```
request:   [u32 magic][u16 version][u16 op][u16 flags][u16 reserved]
           [u32 request_id][u32 payload_len][payload...]
response:  [u32 magic][u16 version][u16 op][u16 flags][u16 reserved]
           [u32 request_id][u32 payload_len][i32 status][body...]
```

All fields little-endian, packed, no alignment padding. `magic` and `version` are the protocol fingerprint per capsule (NOEN/NOCX/NOVF for entropy/crypto/vfs); a wrong magic or wrong version is rejected with `EINVAL` before any handler runs. `request_id` is allocated by the kernel-side client (atomic counter); the capsule echoes it on the response so the client can match replies even when interleaved. `status` rides in the first 4 bytes of the response payload; 0 on success, negative errno on failure.

Used by: `capsule_entropy`, `capsule_crypto`, `capsule_vfs`.

### Legacy seq header (8 bytes)

```
request:   [u32 seq][u16 op][u16 reserved][payload...]
response:  [u32 seq][i32 status][body...]
```

Used by: `capsule_ramfs`, `capsule_keyring`. Migration to the v1 header is a follow-up slice; the runtime contract (no panic on untrusted input, bounded payload, deterministic errno mapping) is identical.

### Per-op payload

The header is followed by the op-specific payload. Layouts are documented per capsule alongside the wire encoders. Example for keyring `STORE`:

```
request:  [u32 caller_pid][u64 now][u64 expires_at][u8 key_type][u16 data_len][data...]
response: [u32 key_id]
```

`caller_pid`, `now`, and `expires_at` are filled in by the kernel-side client from `current_pid()` and `crate::time::timestamp_millis()`. The capsule does not read them from the underlying recv buffer except via this payload, and it never trusts them from any other source.

### Trusted identity

`caller_pid` enters the wire payload only because the kernel-mediated client put it there. There is no path by which a capsule can read identity from anywhere else: the recv buffer is the only source of input, and the kernel client is the only writer to that buffer for the relevant request type. This is the entire reason the capsule can act on per-PID ownership decisions safely.

### Round-trip

```

        │◀─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┤                        │
```

The generation gate runs on every iteration of the recv spin and on the dequeue path before the body is decoded. A respawn between enqueue and reply surfaces as `Stale` even if the new epoch happens to allocate the same `request_id`.

### Failure modes

| Failure | Detection | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Capsule not running | `state::is_alive()` returns false at send time | `Err(Dead)` |
| Capsule died mid-call | `state::is_alive()` rechecks each yield | `Err(Dead)` |
| Reply lost / no response within RECV_YIELDS | counter exhaustion | `Err(TransportFailure)` |
| Reply payload malformed | `decode_response` returns None | `Err(ProtocolMismatch)` |
| Reply payload wrong length for op | per-op check after status | `Err(ProtocolMismatch)` |
| Status != 0 | per-op `errno::map(status)` | typed `Err(NotFound | AccessDenied | ...)` |

There is no infinite wait. The transport spins through `crate::sched::yield_now()` for at most `RECV_YIELDS` iterations, then gives up.

### Endpoint and port allocation

Every server capsule needs two ports and one reply inbox name. Current allocation:

| Capsule | SERVICE_PORT | REPLY_PORT | KERNEL_REPLY_ENDPOINT | REPLY_INBOX | Header |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ramfs | 4096 | 4097 | 0x1_0000_0001 | endpoint.4294967297 | seq |
| keyring | 4098 | 4099 | 0x1_0000_0002 | endpoint.4294967298 | seq |
| entropy | 4100 | 4101 | 0x1_0000_0003 | endpoint.4294967299 | v1 |
| crypto | 4102 | 4103 | 0x1_0000_0004 | endpoint.4294967300 | v1 |
| vfs | 4104 | 4105 | 0x1_0000_0005 | endpoint.4294967301 | v1 |

Rule: claim the next free even SERVICE_PORT, the odd port immediately after as REPLY_PORT, and the next reply endpoint above the 32-bit boundary. The numeric REPLY_INBOX is the decimal of KERNEL_REPLY_ENDPOINT; both kernel-side `spawn_*_capsule()` and userland `KERNEL_REPLY_ENDPOINT` constants must agree.

`docs/production-ledger/05-loader-exec-userspace/capsule-conventions.md` is the canonical allocation table.

## Restart semantics

A server capsule's in-process state is owned by the capsule, not by the kernel. `services::lifecycle::CapsuleState` keeps a generation counter that bumps on every successful spawn, and the per-capsule transport captures the generation at send time. If the generation shifts before the reply lands — i.e. the capsule was respawned mid-call — the transport returns `Stale`, which surfaces as `ESTALE` (or the API's deterministic stale-handle error, e.g. `EIO` for capsule fds). There is no same-request-id collision risk across epochs because the generation gate runs first.

Respawn means an empty store. There is no persistence on the userland side. Capsule respawn is the boundary at which all in-flight ephemeral state is cleared, by design.

## Capability model

Two distinct capability namespaces coexist in the same per-PID `caps: u64` word and are checked by `crate::services::caps::has_capability(pid, bit)` against `crate::syscall::microkernel::capability::CAP_TABLE`.

| Source | Examples | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `crate::capabilities::Capability` | `IPC` (8), `Memory` (16), `Crypto` (32) | what a capsule itself needs to run |
| `crate::services::caps::CAP_*` | `CAP_VFS` (1<<0), `CAP_CRYPTO` (1<<4), `CAP_ENTROPY` (1<<15), `CAP_KEYRING` (1<<16) | what a caller needs to invoke a service |

The bit positions do not overlap; `Capability::Memory` is bit 4 (value 16), `CAP_KEYRING` is bit 16 (value 65536). They share the same word safely.

A capsule itself does not need its own service capability. `capsule_keyring` does not hold `CAP_KEYRING`; it is the keyring. `capsule_entropy` does not hold `CAP_ENTROPY`. Callers do. The kernel-side client checks this at the top of every entry function via `capability::gate_caller()` (or per-op `gate_*` for capsules with multiple cap classes), which reads `current_pid()` and verifies the cap. There is no other entry point into a server capsule on the live path.

## Boot sequence

The capsule spawn points are inside `crate::userspace::init::run_init`. The order is fixed: ramfs first (so anything reading configuration off `/ram` has it), then keyring, then the newer service capsules.

```
init_core_systems
    boot_log + serial
    memory init
    process table init
    capabilities init for init PCB
    ipc init
    crypto rng + kernel keys
    network stack init

userspace::run_init
    spawn legacy *_engine kthreads          gated on nonos-legacy-tree
        crypto engines, signature engines, pq engines, zk engines,
        system services (netmgr, tls, wallet, storage, udev)
    spawn_ramfs_capsule                     real CPL=3 capsule
    spawn_keyring_capsule                   real CPL=3 capsule
    spawn_entropy_capsule                   real CPL=3 capsule
    spawn_crypto_capsule                    real CPL=3 capsule
    spawn_vfs_capsule                       real CPL=3 capsule
    spawn legacy core services              gated on nonos-legacy-tree
    lower init priority
    capsule_proof_io::launch                one-shot, replaces init image
    init_loop
```

`spawn_*_capsule` failures are logged and discarded. The kernel does not fall back to an in-kernel replacement; later requests against the dead capsule return `Err(Dead)` deterministically.

## Cargo profile

Every `capsule_*` crate uses the same release profile:

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `panic` | `abort` | no unwind tables in userland; `_exit(134)` is the panic path |
| `opt-level` | `2` | favour code size and predictable codegen over `3`'s aggressive vectorisation |
| `lto` | `false` | LTO across `compiler_builtins` + `linked_list_allocator` is brittle on `-Zbuild-std`; off until proven necessary |
| `debug` | `false` | release artifacts ship stripped |
| `strip` | `true` | symbol table not needed; the kernel embeds the binary as bytes |

Dev profile mirrors release except `opt-level = 0` and `debug = true`.

## Feature gates

The kernel toggles capsule embed sites via Cargo features in the kernel `Cargo.toml`:

| Feature | Embeds | Spawns |
|---|---|---|
| `nonos-capsule-proof-io` | `capsule_proof_io` | one-shot via `capsule_proof_io::launch()` |
| `nonos-capsule-ramfs` | `capsule_ramfs` | server via `spawn_ramfs_capsule` |
| `nonos-capsule-keyring` | `capsule_keyring` | server via `spawn_keyring_capsule` |
| `nonos-capsule-entropy` | `capsule_entropy` | server via `spawn_entropy_capsule` |
| `nonos-capsule-crypto` | `capsule_crypto` | server via `spawn_crypto_capsule` |
| `nonos-capsule-vfs` | `capsule_vfs` | server via `spawn_vfs_capsule` |
| `nonos-ramfs-smoketest` | adds `crate::fs::ramfs_capsule::smoketest::run()` after spawn | n/a |

When a feature is off, the kernel-side `embed.rs` resolves the binary slice to `&[]`, and `spawn_*_capsule()` returns `Err(FeatureDisabled)` immediately. The kernel still builds.

## Build

The Makefile owns every userland build target. Do not invoke `cargo` against a capsule directly outside of the Makefile; the toolchain pin, target spec, and `-Zbuild-std` flags are coordinated there.

```
make nonos-mk-libc        builds the static libc archive
make nonos-mk-proof-io    builds capsule_proof_io
make nonos-mk-ramfs       builds capsule_ramfs
make nonos-mk-keyring     builds capsule_keyring
make nonos-mk-entropy     builds capsule_entropy
make nonos-mk-crypto      builds capsule_crypto
make nonos-mk-vfs         builds capsule_vfs
```

`capsule_wallpaper` does not yet have a Makefile target; it is built directly from its directory while the graphics lane settles on a target name.

The kernel embeds capsule binaries via `include_bytes!`. The kernel build will fail if a capsule feature is on but the capsule binary is not present at the expected path. Build the capsule first, then the kernel:

```
make nonos-mk-ramfs nonos-mk-capsules
make nonos-mk-keyring nonos-mk-capsules
```

`nonos-mk-capsules` turns on the runtime baseline (`microkernel-capsules` = proof_io + ramfs + keyring); newer capsules (entropy, crypto, vfs) are built individually with their own targets and folded into a smoketest profile once their boot harness is green.

## Adding a new capsule

1. Pick the class. Server or one-shot. If you cannot answer in one sentence, do not ship it.
2. Create `userland/capsule_<name>/` with the same `Cargo.toml` shape as an existing capsule of the same class. Use `package = "nonos_userland_libc"` for the libc dep.
3. Write `src/main.rs` with `#![no_std] #![no_main]`, `#[no_mangle] pub unsafe extern "C" fn _start() -> !`, and either a `heap_init` + `run()` loop (server) or linear work + `_exit(N)` (one-shot).
4. If server: pick the next free SERVICE_PORT/REPLY_PORT pair and the next KERNEL_REPLY_ENDPOINT from the allocation table above. Update both the userland constant and the kernel-side spawner. Update `capsule-conventions.md`.
5. Add a Makefile target after the existing capsule targets. Pattern matches `ramfs_capsule`. Update `.PHONY`.
6. Add a Cargo feature `nonos-capsule-<name>` in the kernel's `Cargo.toml`.
7. Add a kernel-side mirror under the appropriate domain (`src/<domain>/<name>_capsule/`) with `embed.rs`, `error.rs`, `state.rs` (server only), `spawn.rs`, `protocol/` and `client/` (server only).
8. Wire `spawn_<name>_capsule()` into `src/userspace/init/entry.rs`.
9. Add a `kernel-with-<name>` Makefile rule that turns on the new feature alongside its dependencies.

## File-size discipline

Every file in this tree targets ~75 lines and one responsibility. `mod.rs` is declarations and re-exports only; logic lives in sibling files and is named by purpose (`store/state.rs`, not `store/util.rs`). When a file grows past one concept, split it before adding more.

## What this tree is not

It is not a place for shared utility crates. The libc is the only crate every capsule depends on. If two capsules want to share code, the right answer is to grow the libc surface, not to introduce a sibling utility crate.

It is not a place for long-running daemons that own kernel state. State that must survive a respawn lives kernel-side. Capsules are stateless across restarts by design; the kernel-side mirror is what tracks liveness and generation.

It is not a place for build configuration. The Makefile owns build orchestration. Per-capsule `.cargo/config.toml` files do not belong here.

It is not a place for syscall numbering decisions. Numbers come from `crate::syscall::numbers::SyscallNumber` on the kernel side. The libc constants in `libc/src/syscall/numbers.rs` are a mirror, not a source.

It is not a place for capability bit assignments. Cap bits come from `crate::capabilities::types::Capability` and `crate::services::caps::CAP_*` on the kernel side. The userland never assigns its own.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Capsule | a single userland binary that owns one well-defined responsibility |
| Server capsule | infinite recv loop, owns persistent in-process state across requests, one PID for the lifetime of the boot |
| One-shot capsule | linear work then exit, no IPC server, no restart expectation |
| KERNEL_REPLY_ENDPOINT | numeric ID of the inbox the capsule sends responses to; lives above the 32-bit boundary by convention |
| REPLY_INBOX | string form of the above (`endpoint.<decimal>`), used by `nonos_inbox` lookups |
| Generation | monotonic counter in `state.rs` that bumps each time the capsule respawns; kernel handles compare against it to detect stale-after-respawn |
| Kernel-side mirror | the `src/<domain>/<name>_capsule/` tree that owns the spawn point, the IPC client, and the typed error surface for one userland capsule |
| `caller_pid` | the PID of the kernel-side caller, embedded into the request payload by the trusted client; the capsule never reads identity from any other source |
