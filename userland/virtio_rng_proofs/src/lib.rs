//! The virtio-rng bring-up handshake, proved against a register window rather
//! than against a device.
//!
//! Each `#[path]` below pulls in the shipping driver source, so these tests
//! run the code that boots, not a copy of it. Before this crate the driver had
//! no host coverage at all: every line of it was reachable only by booting a
//! machine and hoping the device showed up.
//!
//! The handshake is worth proving without hardware because the virtio
//! specification, not the device, is what fixes it. The status byte must be
//! driven reset, ACKNOWLEDGE, DRIVER, FEATURES_OK, DRIVER_OK in that order,
//! and a device that is told DRIVER_OK before its queue is configured is
//! entitled to do anything at all. Getting that order wrong is wrong against
//! every conforming implementation, which is exactly the class of defect a
//! test with no device can catch.
