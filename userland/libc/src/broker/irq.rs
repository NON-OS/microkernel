//! IRQ binding and notification. Cap requirement: `Irq`. Two flag
//! values are accepted today:
//!
//!   * `0` — legacy INTx. `irq_source` is the device's GSI as
//!     reported by `mk_device_list`; `vector_count` must be 0.
//!   * `MK_IRQ_BIND_MSIX` — MSI-X. `irq_source` must be 0;
//!     `vector_count` is the run length, 1..=64. The kernel
//!     allocates the run, programs the device's MSI-X table, and
//!     returns the BASE grant id and BASE vector. Per-vector grant
//!     ids are derived as `grant_id + i` for `i` in
//!     `0..vector_count`.
