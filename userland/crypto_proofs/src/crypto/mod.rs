// against the real constant-time primitives, not a copy.

// The constant-time primitives deliberately avoid the forms clippy considers

// scans instead of iterators, hand-written rotates. Those manual shapes are
// the point (fixed, data-independent timing), so the style lints are allowed
// on the included source rather than "fixed" into timing side channels.
