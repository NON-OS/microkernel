//! The Browse info panel: what the cursor is on, described, and the controls
//! that act on it. Its strip is reserved out of the content width by
//! `layout::info_x`, the same function the list and the grid subtract, so the
//! panel can never overlap a row. Every band it draws is placed by `info_geom`,
//! which `info_hit` reads back, so no control is drawn where a click is not
//! looked for.
