# capsule_file_manager

## Role

`capsule_file_manager` is a real production application capsule built on
`nonos_app_skeleton`. It owns a static current-directory listing with a cursor
and a selected entry. The capsule keeps its own state, has no globals, and
reads keyboard input through the toolkit. The capsule routes UI rendering
through the toolkit IPC path rather than through any kernel UI code.

```text
file manager app
    |
    | UI frame request
    v
toolkit endpoint
    |
    `-- app event loop on app endpoint
```

## Microkernel contract

The capsule uses the basic Mk surface that every app skeleton uses:

- `MkIpcCall` sends a UI frame request to the toolkit endpoint.
- `MkIpcRecv` receives application messages on the app endpoint.
- `MkYield` backs off when no message is available.
- `MkDebug` emits ownership and proof markers.
- `MkExit` exits when the IPC surface is parked.

The active spawn path is the standard `nonos_app_skeleton::run` entry point.

## Interface contract

| Call | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MkIpcCall` to toolkit | request a UI frame through userland toolkit policy |
| `MkIpcRecv` on app endpoint | receive app input messages |
| `MkYield`, `MkDebug`, `MkExit` | cooperative loop and proof markers |

The keyboard surface accepts `j` and `k` for cursor movement, Enter to select
an entry, and Esc to leave the listing.

## Authority

The capsule keeps the narrow capability set defined by the app skeleton. It
does not request graphics, network, filesystem device drivers, or direct
framebuffer authority. The directory listing visible to the user is a static
in-memory description, not a live filesystem read.

## Privacy and persistence

The capsule keeps no profile, no settings, no telemetry, and no persistent
state. The cursor position and the selected entry disappear with the process.

## Runtime lifecycle

The capsule emits ownership markers, enters the app skeleton run loop, and
processes input events through `MkIpcRecv` until the IPC surface is parked. On
clean shutdown the runtime state is gone with the process.

## Failure model

Toolkit failure is observable through proof markers and never grants the
capsule a fallback framebuffer path. Invalid input is dropped by the file
manager state machine and never escalates to a kernel call.

## Current implemented surface

- Source for the entry list, cursor state, theme, painter, and event loop.
- Static directory listing with cursor navigation.
- Keyboard surface for `j`, `k`, Enter, and Esc.
- Runs above `nonos_app_skeleton` with toolkit-only UI.

## Wire format

Input messages arrive on the app endpoint as toolkit input events. UI requests
go out on the toolkit endpoint.

## State ownership

The capsule owns the entry list, the cursor, and the selected entry. The
toolkit owns rendering. The compositor owns scene and focus. The kernel owns
none of the file manager state.

## Operating rules

- Route UI through toolkit IPC only.
- Do not request direct framebuffer authority.
- Keep all app state volatile.
- Do not introduce kernel UI exports for this app.

## Release target

The release version is a signed application capsule with `Capsule.mk`, signed
manifest, feature gated spawn, toolkit only UI rendering, a manifest contract
for filesystem authority where it is eventually granted, and smoke proof that
file manager policy stays out of the kernel.

## Release checklist

- `Capsule.mk` and signed manifest exist.
- Toolkit IPC smoke passes.
- Feature gated spawn is present.
- Static gate confirms no kernel app UI exports.

## Explicit non-goals today

No production manifest, signed spawn path, persistent settings, real
filesystem reads, network access, graphics driver access, or direct
framebuffer authority belongs in this directory.

## Verification

- Build: `cargo build --manifest-path userland/capsule_file_manager/Cargo.toml`
- Static gate: `bash nonos-ci/run-static-checks.sh`
- Promotion check: add `Capsule.mk`, manifest signing, feature gated spawn,
  and smoke proof before claiming production app status.
