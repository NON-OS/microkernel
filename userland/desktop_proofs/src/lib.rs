//! Host proofs for the desktop's pointer path, end to end. A press on a window
//! travels: the input router hit-tests it through the window manager, focuses
//! the window there, arms its press grab and delivers the press in window
//! coordinates; the window manager raises the window and tells the compositor,
//! which restacks its layer; the window's app_skeleton routes the press to its
//! frame, which starts a drag; every motion after that comes back through the
//! press grab, the app moves its layer and its window. Each step is the real
