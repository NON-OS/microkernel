# capsule_driver_ps2_input

## Role

`capsule_driver_ps2_input` is the userland owner of the IBM-compatible i8042
input controller. It serves the legacy PS/2 keyboard stream and the AUX mouse
stream from one capsule because both devices share ports `0x60` and `0x64`.
Splitting keyboard and mouse into separate capsules would create two owners for
one controller and would break the microkernel device-authority model.

The public service name remains `driver.ps2_kbd0` for compatibility with older
callers. The endpoint now represents the complete i8042 input source: keyboard
events, AUX mouse events, controller status, and bounded diagnostic counters.

## Microkernel contract

The kernel publishes two synthetic platform records:

| Record | Purpose |
|---|---|
| PS/2 keyboard | owns the shared i8042 PIO window and IRQ1 |
| PS/2 AUX | publishes IRQ12 for the same capsule, with no PIO BAR |

The capsule claims both records. Only the keyboard record grants PIO, because
the i8042 data and command ports are shared. The AUX record exists so IRQ12 is
owned, acknowledged, and released through the same broker path as every other
interrupt source.

The capsule uses only microkernel calls:

| Syscall family | Use |
|---|---|
| `MkDeviceList` | discover PS/2 keyboard and AUX platform records |
| `MkDeviceClaim` | bind device authority to this capsule's pid |
| `MkPioGrant` | obtain the i8042 PIO range |
| `MkPioRead` / `MkPioWrite` | access data/status/command ports |
| `MkIrqBind` / `MkIrqAck` | own and acknowledge IRQ1 and IRQ12 |
| `MkIpcRecv` / `MkIpcSend` | serve the driver endpoint |

There is no inline port assembly in the capsule. The static gate rejects raw
`in`/`out` instructions so every byte crosses the broker grant checks.

## Authority

The manifest grants `IPC`, `Memory`, `Driver`, `DeviceEnum`, `Irq`, and `Pio`
(`CAPSULE_REQUIRED_CAPS = 0x158018`). It does not grant `Mmio`, `Dma`,
filesystem, graphics, network, admin, debug, or persistent storage authority.

```text
allowed:
  - i8042 PIO through MkPio*
  - IRQ1 and IRQ12 through MkIrq*
  - bounded in-memory event rings
  - IPC replies to authorized callers

forbidden:
  - persistent key or mouse logs
  - focus decisions
  - text layout or input-method policy
  - window routing
  - direct kernel input paths
```

## Runtime lifecycle

Startup is deliberately ordered so partial ownership does not survive a failed
phase:

1. Discover the PS/2 keyboard platform record.
2. Claim the keyboard record.
3. Grant the i8042 PIO window.
4. Bind IRQ1.
5. Discover and claim the AUX platform record.
6. Bind IRQ12.
7. Drain stale controller output.
8. Enable keyboard scanning.
9. Enable the AUX port, set the controller config byte, reset mouse defaults,
   and enable mouse reporting.
10. Start the IPC service loop.

PIO or IRQ setup failure rolls back broker grants that were already acquired.
If the mouse enable sequence is not acknowledged, the keyboard service still
runs and status replies report `mouse_enabled = 0`.

## Interface contract

| Operation | Meaning | Reply payload after status |
|---|---|---|
| `OP_HEALTHCHECK` | service liveness | none |
| `OP_POLL_EVENTS` | drain keyboard events | `u32 count`, then `count` keyboard records |
| `OP_POLL_MOUSE` | drain AUX mouse events | `u32 count`, then `count` mouse records |
| `OP_GET_STATE` | diagnostic counters | seven little-endian `u64` counters |
| `OP_CONTROLLER_STATUS` | brokered i8042 snapshot | fixed 28-byte controller payload |

## Wire format

Requests use the `NKBD` capsule header, version `1`, and the shared 20-byte
driver envelope. Replies begin with a little-endian signed 32-bit status word.
Status `0` means the operation completed.

## Keyboard Records

`OP_POLL_EVENTS` returns a bounded batch. Each keyboard record is 3 bytes:

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `u8` | scancode byte after decoder handling |
| 1 | `u8` | event flags |
| 2 | `u8` | reserved, always zero |

Overflow is visible through state counters. The capsule drops new events when
the ring is full rather than blocking IRQ handling.

## Mouse Records

`OP_POLL_MOUSE` returns a bounded batch of decoded standard PS/2 mouse packets.
Each mouse record is 8 bytes:

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `i16` | X movement, little-endian |
| 2 | `i16` | Y movement, little-endian, screen-positive upward normalized |
| 4 | `i8` | wheel delta, zero for the base 3-byte protocol |
| 5 | `u8` | button bitset: left, right, middle |
| 6 | `u8` | overflow and parser flags |
| 7 | `u8` | reserved, always zero |

The parser requires bit 3 in the first packet byte for synchronization. Bad
alignment increments `mouse_sync_errors` and never enters the public event
ring.

## State Payload

`OP_GET_STATE` returns these little-endian `u64` counters in order:

| Index | Counter |
|---:|---|
| 0 | keyboard events seen |
| 1 | keyboard events dropped |
| 2 | controller parity errors |
| 3 | controller timeout errors |
| 4 | mouse events seen |
| 5 | mouse events dropped |
| 6 | mouse packet sync errors |

The state payload is diagnostic only. It does not expose raw key history beyond
the bounded event records returned by explicit polling.

## Controller Status Payload

`OP_CONTROLLER_STATUS` reads the status port without reading the data port, so
it cannot consume a pending key or mouse byte. The 28-byte payload is:

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `u8` | raw i8042 status byte |
| 1 | `u8` | output buffer full |
| 2 | `u8` | parity error |
| 3 | `u8` | timeout error |
| 4 | `u32` | queued keyboard events |
| 8 | `u32` | keyboard ring head |
| 12 | `u32` | keyboard ring tail |
| 16 | `u32` | output byte belongs to AUX |
| 20 | `u32` | mouse reporting enabled by setup |
| 24 | `u32` | queued mouse events |

## Privacy and persistence

Keyboard and pointer input is treated as private live data. The capsule keeps
only bounded memory rings and diagnostic counters. It does not write input to
disk, forward input to unrelated services, keep history after process exit, or
decide where input should be delivered.

Focus, compositor routing, lock-screen policy, accessibility policy, keyboard
layout, compose keys, and text rendering belong to higher-level userland
capsules. This driver is only the hardware input source.

## Failure model

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| keyboard platform record missing | startup fails |
| PIO grant denied | startup fails and device claim is released |
| IRQ1 bind denied | PIO grant and device claim are released |
| AUX record or IRQ12 bind denied | keyboard grants are released and startup fails |
| mouse command not acknowledged | keyboard path stays live, mouse status reports disabled |
| key ring full | new keyboard events are dropped and counted |
| mouse ring full | new mouse events are dropped and counted |
| packet sync loss | packet is discarded and counted |

## Current implemented surface

- Broker discovery for the keyboard and AUX platform records.
- Claim/PIO/IRQ setup for i8042, IRQ1, and IRQ12.
- Broker-only i8042 reads and writes, with no inline port assembly.
- Keyboard scanning enable and stale-output drain before service start.
- AUX enable, controller config update, mouse defaults, and report enable.
- Scancode event ring for keyboard input.
- Standard 3-byte PS/2 mouse packet parser and event ring.
- Polling operations for keyboard and mouse events.
- Controller telemetry that does not consume pending data bytes.
- Diagnostic counters for dropped events and controller/parser errors.

## State ownership

The capsule owns the i8042 PIO grant, IRQ1 grant, IRQ12 grant, keyboard decoder
state, AUX packet parser state, and both bounded event rings. It does not own
focus, routing, layout, text conversion, cursor policy, compositor state, or
input persistence. Those decisions are made by higher-level userland capsules.

## Operating rules

- Keep all i8042 access behind `MkPioRead` and `MkPioWrite`.
- Keep IRQ ownership explicit: keyboard on IRQ1, AUX mouse on IRQ12.
- Never persist keyboard or pointer input.
- Never route input to windows from this capsule.
- Never make focus, lock-screen, or text-layout decisions here.
- Drop deterministically on bounded-ring overflow and expose the counter.
- Treat packet sync loss as data-plane damage, not as a kernel fault.

## Release target

The release target for this capsule is a signed i8042 input service that can be
spawned by the kernel mirror, claim the broker records, expose keyboard and AUX
mouse events through the stable endpoint, survive malformed input bytes, report
loss and parser damage, and hand all routing decisions to the userland input
stack.

## Release evidence

Evidence required for release:

- QEMU keyboard injection reaches `OP_POLL_EVENTS`.
- QEMU AUX pointer injection reaches `OP_POLL_MOUSE`.
- Teardown logs show PIO, IRQ1, IRQ12, and both device claims revoked.
- Real legacy PS/2 hardware records keyboard and mouse events.
- USB-only hardware boots without requiring this capsule.

## Release checklist

- Signed manifest and kernel mirror are present.
- `make -B nonos-mk-driver-ps2-input` passes.
- Static checks pass for broker-only PIO and AUX IRQ12 wiring.
- QEMU keyboard and mouse input smoke passes.
- Event overflow and packet sync-loss counters are observable.
- Real hardware proof is attached to the release record.

## Explicit non-goals today

This capsule does not implement USB HID, keyboard layouts, compose keys,
international input methods, accessibility policy, focus routing, screen-lock
policy, text rendering, compositor cursor policy, or persistent input logs.

## Verification

Run these from the repository root:

```sh
make -B nonos-mk-driver-ps2-input
bash nonos-ci/run-static-checks.sh
```

The static checks require:

- no raw PIO assembly in the capsule;
- broker setup phases roll back partial grants;
- the controller-status operation is present;
- the AUX mouse path is wired through IRQ12, packet parsing, and `OP_POLL_MOUSE`;
- the endpoint string `driver.ps2_kbd0` remains present for compatibility.

## Evidence still required

Before this driver is called hardware-complete, the remaining evidence is:

- QEMU keyboard scancode injection reaches `OP_POLL_EVENTS`;
- QEMU AUX pointer injection reaches `OP_POLL_MOUSE`;
- teardown logs show PIO, IRQ1, IRQ12, and both device claims revoked;
- a real machine with legacy PS/2 input records keyboard and mouse events;
- a USB-only machine proves the absence of this capsule does not block the USB
  HID path.
