//! `Scalar` and `FieldElement` zeroize themselves on drop, so the nonce and
//! the private scalar are covered. The byte buffers around them were not: RFC
//! 6979 builds `V || 0x00 || key || hash` in a 97-byte array, so the private
//! key sits in plain bytes on the stack, and the function used to return
//! without touching it. That is a copy of the key left where the next call in
//! this capsule reuses the stack.
