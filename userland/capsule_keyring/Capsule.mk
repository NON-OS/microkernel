# keyring — userland service capsule. The capsule itself is the
# keyring authority, so it does not hold `Capability::Keyring`;
# callers carry that bit and reach the capsule through IPC. The
# capsule needs IPC for `mk_ipc_*`, Memory for the heap, and
# Crypto for the kernel crypto syscall path it drives internally.
