//! Every key this window answers to, written down once.

//! The dispatcher used to match on bare hex, and nothing on screen said any of
//! these existed. Twenty shortcuts that only a reader of the source could find
//! are not features. The obvious fix is a help overlay, but a second list typed
//! out by hand would drift from the first the day someone rebinds a key, and a
//! help screen that lies is worse than none.
//!
//! So this is the list, and both the dispatcher and the overlay walk it. A key
//! that is not here does nothing; a key here that the dispatcher cannot act on
//! fails to compile.
