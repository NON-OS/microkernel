//! How the machine's dangerous authority is spread, and what has moved.
//!
//! This card used to read "20" over "of 44 processes". That number is already on
//! screen as a column of shields, and it answers a question nobody asks: whether
//! twenty capsules are privileged matters far less than which authority they
//! hold, because the four sensitive classes are not interchangeable. One capsule
//! with raw hardware reach is a different machine from one with debug.
//!
//! Nothing here is measured or inferred. Every capsule declared its authority in
//! a signed manifest and the kernel granted exactly that set, so these are the
//! grants themselves, not a guess from behaviour.
//!
//! Counts come from `Monitor::posture`, which the security screen also reads, so
//! the two cannot disagree; the class order and colours come from
//! `risk_strip::CLASSES`, so a row's slots and this card cannot either.
