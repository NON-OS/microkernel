//! Intel LPSS I2C bring-up, proved against a register window rather than
//! against a controller.
//!
//! Each `#[path]` below pulls in the shipping driver source, so these tests
//! run the code that boots, not a copy of it. This capsule carries the
//! touchpad on every Intel laptop this system targets, and until now a line
//! of its bring-up could only be run by booting one of those laptops.
//!
//! What is provable here is what the DesignWare databook and Intel's LPSS
//! wrapper fix in writing: which register proves MMIO is alive, which reset
//! must be deasserted first, and which registers are read-only once the core
//! is enabled. Getting those wrong breaks every part that implements them.
