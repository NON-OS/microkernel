//! Releasing the LPSS reset before anything else is touched.
//!
//! init/mod.rs:58-65 states it: "On Skylake and later the wrapper powers up
//! with the function and iDMA resets asserted, which leaves the core dead.
//! Writing LPSS_PRIV_RESETS = 0x7 deasserts them. This has to run once,
//! before the first DesignWare register access in disable()."
//!
//! Order is the property, not presence. A deassert that happens after the
//! core has already been configured leaves those writes to a block still in
//! reset, so they land nowhere and the controller comes up looking healthy
//! and carrying none of its settings.
