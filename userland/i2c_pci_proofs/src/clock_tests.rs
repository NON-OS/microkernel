//! Programming the SCL counts, and only while it is allowed.

//! init/mod.rs:45-46 states it: "Writes the standard and fast SCL count pairs
//! plus the SDA hold time. Only valid while IC_ENABLE is 0; these registers
//! are read-only once enabled."
//!
//! Read-only means the writes are dropped, not refused. A controller
//! configured while enabled reports every register write as accepted, then
//! emits no SCL clock at all, so every transfer times out on a bus that
//! measures electrically perfect.
