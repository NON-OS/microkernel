//! Shared wire-form ABI for the NONOS marketplace pipeline.
//!
//! Field shape and order match the canonical schema at
//! `abi/marketplace_index.schema.json`. The codec is a length-
//! prefixed binary form, not JSON or CBOR: a marketplace index
//! ships as a single signed blob, and a tight binary parser keeps
//! the userland attack surface narrow.
//!
//! This crate covers the *index* layer only. Per-package detail —
//! the manifest, per-arch artifacts, package signatures — lives
//! inside the package and is governed by
//! `abi/capsule_manifest.schema.json` and
//! `abi/capsule_package.schema.json`. capsule_market parses the
//! index and serves it; capsule_installer (later) pulls the
//! package and walks the manifest. The two layers are
//! intentionally disjoint so the marketplace layer can never speak
//! for the manifest layer.
//!
//! Field-name conventions follow the canonical schemas:
//! - `required_capabilities` holds the `CAP_*` names defined in
//!   `capsule_manifest.schema.json#/$defs/CapName`. The crate
//!   carries them as opaque strings; rejecting an unknown name is
//!   the installer's job.
//! - `supported_arches` holds the canonical target triples from
//!   `capsule_package.schema.json` (`x86_64-nonos`,
//!   `aarch64-nonos`, `riscv64-nonos`).
//! - `PriceModel` mirrors the four payment-policy modes from the
//!   manifest (`free`, `one_time`, `subscription`, `usage_metered`).
