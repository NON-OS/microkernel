/*
 * A fixed muting factor cannot work across schemes. Solarized dark puts its own
 * foreground 4.86:1 above its own raised surface, barely over the 4.5:1 floor,
 * while Aurora puts its text at 14.45:1. Muting both by the same third leaves
 * Aurora comfortable and Solarized at 2.81:1, which is below the floor and is
 * exactly the reading a person with low vision cannot follow. A factor safe for
 * Solarized leaves every other scheme's secondary label indistinguishable from
 * its primary one.
 *
 * So the factor is the most muting the scheme can take: it walks back towards
 * the text colour until the result clears the floor against both the ground and
 * the raised surface, because a label does not know which it will be drawn on.
