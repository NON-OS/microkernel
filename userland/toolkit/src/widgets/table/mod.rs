//! A table: a header of column titles over striped rows of cells. Each `Col`
//! is fixed or takes a share of what the fixed ones leave, so the columns
//! fill the width given. The table draws only the rows it is given: a long
//! list passes the slice on screen and, with `first`, where that slice
//! starts, so the app scrolls by whole rows under a header that stays put.
//! `hit` names a header, for sorting, or a row and column, as a `Cell`, and
//! `cell_rect` and `head_rect` say where each one is drawn.
