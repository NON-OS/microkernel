//! A pill: a short status label on a fully rounded body, with an optional
//! status dot in front of it. The pill is drawn at its own size, at the left
//! edge of the box it is given and centred vertically in it, so an app passes
//! the box it wants the pill in. With a tone and no dot the label takes the
//! tone's colour; with a dot the dot carries the tone and the label stays in
//! `text`. A category takes the tone's place on the dot, or fills the whole
//! body; a count follows the label in `muted` digits.
