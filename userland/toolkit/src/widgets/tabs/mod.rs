//! A tab strip: a row of labelled tabs, one of them selected, for switching
//! between views of the same screen. The app owns `selected` and `hovered`
//! and changes them from `hit`. `State::disabled` greys the whole strip and
//! `State::focused` rings the selected tab; the other `State` flags are
//! ignored, since hover and selection here belong to one tab, not the strip.
