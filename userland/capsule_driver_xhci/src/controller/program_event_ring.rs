//! Program interrupter 0's event-ring registers and enable its IE
//! latch. The spec mandates the order: ERSTSZ first, ERDP second
//! (initial dequeue = segment base), ERSTBA last — that's the
//! write the controller treats as "event ring is now valid".
//! After that the interrupter's IE bit unmasks event-completion
//! interrupts; the master USBCMD.INTE gate is set later in
//! `start::start`.
