//! Which stream a new conversation with a proxy names.

//! A proxy keys a conversation on our pid and the stream a frame names, and
//! holds at most eight for one caller (capsule_socks5 server/who.rs,
//! capsule_net_anon server/socks/who.rs). The browser names streams from a
//! small fixed set, the lowest free one first, so it never asks for more
//! than the proxy gives and a stream it let go without the proxy hearing is
//! reset by the next conversation that takes its number.

//! Pure; the proofs hold it.
