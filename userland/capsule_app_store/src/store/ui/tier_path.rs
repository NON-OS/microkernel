//! The path a Qwen tier's model takes, in the detail pane: while it comes,
//! how far, how fast and by which network; before Install, the network it
//! would leave by, and for a large download through Nym or Anyone the
//! estimate and the offer of a direct one, which `d` takes. The stick tier
//! says it is imported from a release stick with no network when this
//! stick carries it; whether it does is the kernel's to say at the import.
