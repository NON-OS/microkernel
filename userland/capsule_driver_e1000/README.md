# capsule_driver_e1000

## Role

`capsule_driver_e1000` is the Intel 8254x Ethernet driver capsule. It owns the
PCI NIC, MMIO registers, RX/TX DMA rings, and raw Ethernet frame movement.
It deliberately stops at the Ethernet frame boundary.

    `-- IRQ completion path owned by capsule
```

## Microkernel contract

Hardware access is mediated by Mk and broker syscalls:

- `MkDeviceList` locates the Intel NIC record.
- `MkDeviceClaim` owns the NIC claim and claim epoch.
- `MkMmioMap` maps BAR0.
- `MkIrqBind`, `MkIrqPoll`, and `MkIrqAck` own INTx interrupts.
- `MkDmaMap` and `MkDmaUnmap` allocate RX/TX descriptors and packet buffers.
- `MkIpcRecv` and `MkIpcSend` serve `driver.e1000_0` on
  `service:4210:driver.e1000_0`.

The kernel never parses Ethernet, ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, DHCP, or socket
state. It only enforces capabilities and revokes grants.

## Interface contract

| Operation | Meaning | Reply payload |
|---|---|---|
| `OP_HEALTHCHECK` | server liveness | status word |
| `OP_LINK_STATUS` | link-up state | 1 byte |
| `OP_MAC_ADDRESS` | hardware MAC address | 6 bytes |
| `OP_TX_PACKET` | transmit one Ethernet frame | status word |
| `OP_RX_PACKET` | poll one received frame | length plus frame bytes |

## Authority

The manifest grants `IPC`, `Memory`, `Driver`, `DeviceEnum`, `Mmio`, `Irq`,
and `Dma` (`CAPSULE_REQUIRED_CAPS = 0xF8018`). It has no socket, routing,
firewall, filesystem, admin, or debug authority.

```text
allowed:   NIC claim, BAR0 MMIO, IRQ, RX/TX DMA, raw-frame IPC
forbidden: IP policy, socket policy, packet capture store, kernel drivers
```

## Privacy and persistence

Frames are transient. Packet data lives in DMA buffers and IPC payloads only
for the duration of RX/TX handling. The capsule does not persist captures,
record peers, keep application identity, or log payloads by default.

## Runtime lifecycle

The capsule claims the NIC, maps BAR0, allocates RX/TX DMA rings, resets and
programs the device, reads MAC state, enables interrupts, and serves raw-frame
IPC. Teardown disables the device path and returns all broker grants.

## Failure model

Setup failure rolls back grants in reverse order. Runtime TX failure returns a
NIC fault without retrying inside the kernel. RX empty is non-fatal. Link-down
is reported to callers rather than hidden.

## Current implemented surface

- Claims an e1000 PCI NIC through the broker.
- Maps BAR0 and resets/programs device registers.
- Allocates RX/TX descriptor rings and packet buffers through `MkDmaMap`.
- Reads the hardware MAC address.
- Serves link, MAC, RX packet, and TX packet operations over IPC.
- Rolls broker grants back during setup failure and process teardown.

## Wire format

Requests use the `NE10` capsule header, version `1`, and the shared 20-byte
driver envelope. Replies start with a 4-byte status word. MAC replies carry
6 bytes. Link replies carry 1 byte. RX replies carry a 4-byte frame length
followed by the Ethernet frame. TX requests carry one Ethernet frame bounded
by `MAX_ETHERNET_FRAME`.

## State ownership

The capsule owns descriptor rings, packet buffers, MMIO register state, link
snapshot, MAC address, and IRQ grant. `net.l2` owns protocol interpretation.
The kernel owns only grant records and interrupt delivery.

## Operating rules

- Keep the service frame-oriented; never add ARP/IP/TCP/UDP branches here.
- Refill RX buffers before exposing receive service as release-grade.
- Treat link-down and RX-empty as normal return states, not kernel events.
- Never retain packet payloads after the reply or TX completion path ends.

## Release target

The finished e1000 capsule is a signed, embedded, spawned raw-frame NIC service
with QEMU and hardware smoke coverage. It owns link bring-up, interrupt
recovery, RX/TX ring refill, error counters, and frame delivery to `net.l2`.
It never grows ARP, IP, sockets, firewall, or capture policy.

## Release evidence

Release requires QEMU `e1000` frame round trip, link-down behavior, teardown
DMA revocation proof, and one compatible hardware boot with RX/TX counters
moving through `net.l2`.

## Release checklist

- Signed manifest and kernel mirror present.
- QEMU e1000 TX/RX smoke passes through `net.l2`.
- Link state changes are visible over IPC.
- DMA teardown proof shows descriptor and packet buffers are revoked.
- Hardware boot records MAC, link, RX, and TX without kernel packet parsing.

## Explicit non-goals today

No ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, DHCP, DNS, routing, sockets, firewall, packet capture,
traffic analytics, or RSS/multi-queue policy lives in this capsule.

## Verification

- Build: `make -B nonos-mk-driver-e1000`
- Static gate: `bash nonos-ci/run-static-checks.sh`
- Architecture check: e1000 must remain free of kernel driver imports and use
  broker MMIO/IRQ/DMA only.
- Documentation check: this README is required by CI and must cover authority,
  privacy, current surface, release evidence, non-goals, and verification.
