//! The claims this window cannot settle, and why.
//!
//! This is the card that makes the other two worth reading. A verification
//! surface that lists only what it can prove is telling you a selected truth: the
//! reader has no way to know what was left out, and every system's About box
//! looks complete for exactly that reason.
//!
//! So the claims that cannot be tested from here are named, each with the reason
//! it is out of reach and the place it is actually settled. Two of them are out
//! of reach precisely because this capsule is confined, which is the system
//! working rather than failing.
