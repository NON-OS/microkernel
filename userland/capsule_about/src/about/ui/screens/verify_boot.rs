//! What the bootloader established before the kernel existed, read back.

//! The kernel's own syscall is explicit that it re-verifies none of this: it
//! hands back the record the bootloader wrote into the handoff. So the card says
//! so in its own subtitle. A reader who mistakes this for a live check would draw
