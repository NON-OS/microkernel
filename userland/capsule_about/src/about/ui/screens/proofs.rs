//! The live proof board: one answer at the top, and under it every check the
//! answer rests on, each of which can fail.
//!
//! Read once a second while the screen is open (`State::refresh_proofs`), so
//! a route that drops, a capsule that starts, or a report that goes stale is
//! on screen within a second of happening. Nothing here is a claim the window
//! makes for itself: every row is the kernel's table, the kernel's registry,
//! the bootloader's record or a transport's own report, judged by rules
//! proven on the host.
