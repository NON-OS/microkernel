/*
 * The compositor reads the shared surface whenever it composites, on another
 * CPU while this one paints. A frame drawn in place is cleared to transparent
 * and then built up row by row, so a composite in between showed the desktop
 * through the window, or only its top rows: with several CPUs about every
 * other presented frame lost the window while an app repainted busily. Each
 * frame is drawn in a private buffer and copied over the surface in one pass,
 * so the compositor only ever sees a whole frame, old or new. When the heap
 * cannot spare the buffer the frame is drawn in place as before.
