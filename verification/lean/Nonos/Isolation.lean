Specification-level proofs of the memory-isolation properties. The real kernel
code that implements them is proven to match by the runnable + Kani harnesses in
`userland/kernel_proofs` (the `to_pte_flags` encoding and the `check_range`
bounds). Lean proves the property; the code proofs discharge it on the
implementation.
