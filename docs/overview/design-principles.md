# Design principles

The rules the NONOS code follows, each with the code or the check that holds it, and the places where it does not hold yet.

## Least privilege by capability word

Every process holds a [capability word](glossary.md#capability-word), a mask over the 36 capability bits the kernel defines (`capability_table` in `src/capabilities/types/defs.rs:21-83`). A capsule's word comes from its signed [manifest](glossary.md#manifest): its required bits, plus those of its optional bits the spawning code allows (`install_caps` in `src/security/capsule_manifest/verify/caps_bits.rs:38-47`). A grant outside the manifest is refused with `GrantOutsideManifest` (`check_grant` in `src/security/capsule_manifest/verify/caps.rs:31-39`). Every syscall the kernel knows then passes `dispatch`, which refuses with EPERM when the caller's capability does not resolve for that call (`src/syscall/contract/dispatch.rs:25-40`).

Services hold the same line. The file store answers only the kernel and holders of FileSystem (`CAP_FILE_SYSTEM` in `userland/capsule_vfs/src/server/fs_gate.rs:17-40`). The NVMe, AHCI and virtio-blk drivers serve raw sectors only to the kernel's own client and to holders of StoreWrite (`permits` in `userland/capsule_driver_nvme/src/server/medium.rs:17-30`). Each asks the kernel on every request instead of caching the answer, so a verdict never outlives the process it was about.

The checks: `scripts/cap_audit.py --strict` holds every capsule's mask to the calls its code makes, and `scripts/check_mirror_caps.py` holds each kernel spawn file and README to its manifest. `nonos-ci/run-static-checks.sh` runs both inside the `static-tree` flake check. On this commit both report ok, and `static-tree` fails on a different rule.

The limits: two bits, `IO` and `Hardware`, enforce nothing (`src/capabilities/types/defs.rs:23-31`). Exiting, yielding, futex waits, reading the clock and reading process stats take no bit, only a valid capability token (`check` in `src/syscall/contract/cap_table/mk.rs:20-35`).
