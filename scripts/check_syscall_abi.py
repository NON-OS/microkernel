"""Check that every published syscall is one a capsule can actually reach.

`abi/syscalls.toml` is what a libc or a foreign toolchain reads to learn how
to call this kernel. Publishing a number there is a promise, and the promise
is only kept if a capsule placing that number in `rax` arrives at the handler.

Reaching a handler takes five things, and missing any one of them fails the
call silently, at a different place each time:

  registry     `abi/registry/*.rs` turns the raw number into a `SyscallNumber`.
               Missing, and `from_u64` returns None and the entry point
               answers ENOSYS before any of the rest of this exists.
  enum         `numbers/defs.rs` is where the variant and its tag are declared.
  cap table    `contract/cap_table/*.rs` decides who may call it. The table is
               total by a trailing `unwrap_or(false)`, so a variant no family
               claims is refused for everyone, permanently and quietly.
  router       `dispatch/router/*.rs` picks the family that handles it. A
               variant no family matches falls to the router's default.
  handler      for the microkernel family, an arm in `microkernel/dispatch/`
               keyed on the `SYS_*` constant. Without it `route` returns -1.

The earlier version of this check read the enum and the microkernel constants
and asked only whether the tag appeared in one of them. A `SYS_*` constant on
its own dispatches nothing, because `route` is reached through the registry
and the enum, so three syscalls sat published, implemented, and unreachable,
with this check reporting agreement: the attestation document, and both
halves of the developer-root enrolment handshake.

So the direction that matters is: published, therefore reachable. The reverse
direction, a syscall the kernel dispatches and the ABI does not publish, is
listed rather than fatal unless --strict, because it is a capability nobody
outside the tree can name yet.
