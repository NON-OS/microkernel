"""What a serial log has to say for the boot to count.

The markers are the kernel's own lines, the same ones nonos-verify reads. A
cell with more than one CPU must hear from every one of them; a cell with an
IOMMU must not hear that DMA is unrestricted. Every cell must see the ring-0
restrictions read back on: SMEP, SMAP, NX and WP, from the kernel's own
[CPU-PROT] line rather than from what the code asked the part for.
