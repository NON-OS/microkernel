"""Boot the built images across the machine matrix and say which cells fail.

    boot_matrix.py --esp up=target/boot-matrix/esp-up --esp smp=target/boot-matrix/esp-smp \\
        --ovmf /path/OVMF_CODE.fd --ovmf-vars target/qemu-OVMF_VARS.fd \\
        --blk-img target/qemu-virtio-blk.img --repeat 5

A cell passes when every one of its boots reaches readiness with nothing
fatal in the log, all its CPUs online, and DMA restricted when an IOMMU is
present. The exit status is the number of failing boots. `make
nonos-mk-boot-matrix` builds both images and runs this.
