"""No colour literal may be added to the shared widgets or a migrated app's UI.

A widget or a migrated screen takes its colours from the theme's roles, so a
theme chosen in Settings reaches it. An ARGB literal there is a colour no theme
can change. Every one left is listed against scripts/baselines/ui-literals.txt,
a list that may only shrink. An app joins SCOPES when it moves to the roles.
