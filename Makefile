# NONOS microkernel build.

# A capability-based, RAM-resident microkernel. The kernel and every capsule
# ship a transparent post-quantum STARK attestation, are dual-signed with
# Ed25519 and ML-DSA-65, and boot behind an anti-rollback floor measured into
# the TPM.
#
# Everything a human needs is on this page; `make help` prints it.
#
#     make              build the production image (the default)
#     make qemu         build it and boot under QEMU + OVMF + a software TPM
#     make usb          build the real-hardware image; DISK=/dev/... writes it
#     make menuconfig   choose your own components, then: make from-config
#     make test         the boot-and-verify harness CI gates on
#     make bench        measured performance, with provenance, never invented
#     make doctor       check this host has what the build and boot need
#     make clean        remove build artefacts    (fmt to format the tree)
#
# The build is split by concern into mk/*.mk, with per-capsule rules in
# userland/*/Capsule.mk. The nonos-mk-* targets those define are the internals
# CI drives; they all still work, they are just not the surface. This file is
# the curated top over them and defines nothing a person has to memorise.

# Per-user build configuration from `make menuconfig`. Optional: the leading
# dash keeps an absent file from being an error, so a fresh checkout builds.

# ── The image that ships ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The full ZeroState system: every capsule and driver, TPM-measured boot, a
# transparent STARK attestation for the kernel and each capsule, dual Ed25519 +
# ML-DSA-65 signatures, and an anti-rollback floor. Fail-closed: without an
# enrolled identity it stops rather than shipping a forgeable one. NONOS_DEV=1
# mints a clearly marked throwaway identity for evaluation (mk/00-config.mk).
#
# The build does not end at packaging: it ends by verifying itself. Five
# independent checks (ledger, signatures, declared caps, STARK membership with
# the same gate the kernel enforces, root embedding) run against the artifacts
# just written, and the build receipt records the measured result. A build
# that cannot prove what it produced does not get to say it is ready.
#
# The kernel, the ESP and the ISO are built from the recipe rather than named
# as prerequisites: prerequisites resolve in parallel, and packing an ESP
# beside the link that produces its kernel puts the previous kernel on the
# shipping image.

# Proving is a release cost, never an iteration cost. One changed capsule

# keystroke. `make dev` rebuilds and signs what changed and boots with stale
# proofs tolerated in rollout mode, labelled as such at build and at every
# spawn. `make` stays the only path that proves; `make verify` will correctly
# refuse a dev tree, which is the system working.
